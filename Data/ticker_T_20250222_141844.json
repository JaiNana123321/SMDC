Who thinks they can predict world events? Who thinks and acts on probabilities? Investors. And not just any investors. I’m not talking people tryna scrape 5% gains. I’m talking real wsb degens, who have amazing DDs then put in a weekly call cuz they think they can time the market. I’m talking people who see bars on a chart and perform advanced “technical analysis” to predict movement. I’m talking people who saw AI coming and didn't think \"oh shit\" they thought \"how can I monetize this\".\n\nWhen I got schizophrenia I felt lonely for many years. But today I had an epiphany. I don’t belong nowhere, I belong among the wsb degens of the world.\n\nYou guys. You guys are my people. And today, my soul has found peace. Because I finally belong somewhere.

      "selftext": "Hello Regards,\n\nDroneshield (DRO) is showing promising returns and WSB seems unaware. A quick search on google trends would make it seem that the USA are not aware of the stock at the moment. So here is a small DD to get this beauty of a company on your radar and not leave all the tendies to the Germans and Australians. \n\n  \nPlain and simple:\n\nDRO develops and sells anti-drone tech. DRO engineers, produces and maintains their own products. \n\nCostumers: EU countries that are ramping up their drone defense systems since Ukraine has demonstrated the dangers of drones. Countries neighboring China since they also can't keep their drones to themselves. South American countries that are trying to counter the use of drones by the drug cartels.\n\nAdded value: Their products protect and save lives.\n\n[Their revenue is ramping up with repeat orders by satisfied customers.](https://preview.redd.it/zp0bc0imhkke1.png?width=1058&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc4cd9e2d400ab64f4fdeee2bcf84c4b8293e514)\n\n.\n\n[They manage to maintain super healthy gross profit margins.](https://preview.redd.it/oy2dheyyhkke1.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfcdc462de4e6c547a8c3325948efb6256ba61bd)\n\n.\n\n[Net profit margin transitioned into the green. ](https://preview.redd.it/hrvdph1qikke1.png?width=1057&format=png&auto=webp&s=596bfe90e67ba299511afd52132c499501c31797)\n\nWhy is the net profit margin relatively low: 200 of their 255 employees are engineers that R&D this company to perfection. My guess is that this is quite expensive. Droneshield understands: great value comes from great products. And great products bring in great costumers.\n\n  \nHere is a page out of their latest earnings report. This update caused the reverse of the trend. It shows that their revenue spike was not a one off event but only the beginning of the profitable era. Read the full report here: [https://static1.squarespace.com/static/660a32624c94dd36e509baf3/t/67995f878b0b2b6c9b290038/1738104717089/4C\\_4Q24.pdf](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/660a32624c94dd36e509baf3/t/67995f878b0b2b6c9b290038/1738104717089/4C_4Q24.pdf)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7ow29x92okke1.png?width=633&format=png&auto=webp&s=26bcc8aedaa65b0100d586dfea9b91a4bdcb543b\n\nNegative: DRO takes on very little debt, to little. Instead they have gradually over the years sold more shares. I would say this should slow down now cash is coming in through sales. \n\n  \nFurthermore they maintain a very healthy balance sheet with 220 million cash balance. Check out their website. Its a piece of art on its own: [https://www.droneshield.com/investor-relations](https://www.droneshield.com/investor-relations)\n\n  \nMy humble position:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ikyzvcrqfkke1.png?width=1534&format=png&auto=webp&s=565d7e0a27412ff805ca54df26f64635d2263423\n\nI plan to stay in for the long run. But if it moons again like last time I will take profit and step back in when the dust settled. \n\nThere is a lot more to be said about this company. But I leave that for the discussion. I hope I have been of service to my fellow regards at WSB.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. No AI was used making this DD.

      "title": "the sector you've never touched IS a 10-bagger, but not like that [DD w/ $250k invested)",
      "selftext": "A few days ago, I saw the[ \\[DD\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ir0k5o/this_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_dd/) posted here about the mining industry. The OP of this post was right to point out that the mining sector is due for a massive run and I appreciated the attention they drew to the qualities of a high return opportunity.  However, their recommendation was mostly to invest in mining related to GOLD! Reading that was like watching one set the dining table beautifully, only to proceed to mistake the appetizer for the main dish.\n\nToday I’m going to provide further evidence for the case that the mining industry presents a massive opportunity on a timescale anywhere from right now to the end of Trump’s term. The investments that are going to make you rich, however, have nothing to do with gold, per se, and everything to do with titanium, lithium, rare earth minerals, and the complete market dominance China has over their processing and extraction.\n\n**Part I: Ukraine, Greenland, Russia, Cosmetic Moguls, and the Allied Supply Chain**\n\nWhy does Trump care so much about Greenland? Why is he so insistent on Ukraine signing away 50% of their claim to Ukraine’s minerals and, if that matters so much, why did he cut Ukraine out from the opening negotiations with Russia?\n\nThe answer is that it's all about the supply chain of minerals and metals. China is bending us over the table with their grip over the chain (80-90%+ dominance), especially in separation/processing of the materials. Recently, they [have gone as far as to ban key processing/separation materials needed](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-lithium-company-halts-tech-exports-trade-tensions-build-2025-02-18/), posturing to protect their interests in the face of American policy strides to distance themselves from their grip over the market. They have also kept costs of lithium and other precious earth and minerals artificially low, stymieing western incentive to establish their own supply chain.\n\n[China has been *SO* effective at doing all of this,](https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/china-dominant-mineral-mining-global-supply-chain-e2b7840e) that until the last few years, there was **ZERO** mining/processing of rare earth happening domestically in the USA. The picture wasn’t much better for other crucial metals and resources, such as lithium and titanium. We slept too long, took them for granted, and now here we are.\n\nDon’t understand the stakes? [Here is **Marco Rubio**](https://uscriticalmaterials.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Marco-Rubio-video.mp4), our present secretary of state and who has recently opened up peace negotiations with Russia over Ukraine, being an absolute doomer about the state of play with the supply chain. **Lindsey Graham -** another key Trump ally - also has eyes on the issue, especially as it pertains to Ukraine and what they may offer us for security (check out these tweets [here ](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1891046931323040187)and [here](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1799832487285465244)).\n\nLet me be clear that this is a bipartisan issue and it is *extremely* difficult to deny the threat this poses to our national security and economic prosperity (the previous administration came to the same conclusion). That is why it has been a priority of both administrations. However, this present iteration of the Trump administration is uniquely situated to set the market ablaze in ways that previous administrations could not.\n\n**Part II. Convergence, Timing, Trump Administration, Private Equity, Executive Action**\n\nAlright, so we have established that the US is seriously threatened by China’s stranglehold over this sector. What is this administration doing and who are the relevant people involved? I don’t have time to give you all of the reasons that point me in favor of a bullish sentiment on titanium, lithium, and rare earth minerals. Here are a few that I take to be really supportive, however.\n\nFirst, let me introduce you to **Ronald S. Lauder**, heir to the Estée Lauder cosmetics company. For whatever reason, this guy has a real penchant for minerals and mining. He is [*close friends* with Donald Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/trump-ukraine-rare-earth-minerals.html) and is, according to the NY times, the one that initially led Trump to turn his attention to Greenland. He is also very interested in Ukrainian minerals and metals.\n\nYou see, Ronald Lauder is a business partner of **Brian Menell**, CEO of private investment/equity firm [**Techmet**](https://www.techmet.com/), which seeks to expand production of precious minerals across our global assets to help ensure a secure and sustainable supply of the key metals for western-aligned interests.\n\nIf there is one company to look at and one company alone, it is Techmet. Recently, they have secured 180 million from **QIA**. They are **DOE and DFC** contractors with extremely lucrative deals over the last few years. Furthermore, what makes them unusual is that the DFC decided against their usual financing terms and actually went ahead and bought a direct stake in Techmet itself. That means the **US Federal Government** is a stakeholder directly aligned with the interests and priorities of Techmet. \n\nAs if this was not enough, Techmet also has the investment/backing of energy behemoth Mercuria. They also hold advisory members and business partners from big name mining companies like Rio Tinto. Furthermore, their current chairman is **Admiral Mike Mullen** who was previously Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, as well as on the board of **General Motors. S**uffice to say that their present reach and influence over western government is compelling as anything I have ever seen before. \n\nIf you are curious, here is the CEO Brian Menell two or so weeks ago discussing the present state of the administration and supply chain issues [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP9_PY5gEug&ab_channel=SmarterMarkets%E2%84%A2) He is bullish about this administration and highlights what needs to happen in order to compete with China effectively. \n\nWhat does he stress? **Permitting, Bureaucracy Reform, Federal Incentivization.** He calls on the administration to lift regulations, give permits quickly, purchase directly and invest in western-aligned companies that are working on the energy transition. Trump is doing *exactly* this, from establishing the sovereign wealth fund, to the guidance issued by way of two executive actions “[Unleashing American Energy”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/), as well as  [“Unleashing Prosperity through Deregulation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-prosperity-through-deregulation/).”\n\nI recommend you read the language, especially Section 9 of the executive order on energy. The order seeks to “establish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states” as well as “to protect the United States' economic and national security and military preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation”\n\nBy way of the executive orders, federal agencies are instructed (within 60 days) to identify and eliminate barriers to efficient private investment and reduce project timelines for critical energy. Trump also instructs that priority should be placed on making sure USA funds critical mineral ventures and he also instructs to make sure the USA has an adequate stockpile of critical minerals/metals (and to purchase more if not). Emphasis is also placed on geologic mapping, and key western partnerships that share national  security interests, called the **“Quad.”** If you are interested in further reading on this last point, I recommend[ this article ](https://www.orfonline.org/research/the-case-for-a-quad-mineral-security-partnership#_edn81)on Quadrilateral Mineral Partnerships.\n\nHere is another item in the order on Unleashing American Energy:\n\n>(j) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy that includes policy recommendations to enhance the competitiveness of American mining and refining companies in other mineral-wealthy nations.\n\nTrump is not a patient man. He will act quickly after receiving this report in March and he is already trying his best to wrap up Ukraine as quickly as possible too with assurances of mineral access. That's why I believe the shortest timeline to return is now to the end of Trump's term.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that Trump's team began negotiations without Ukraine precisely because they are seeking to get the best minerals deal possible. Russian advances on Ukraine have meant that many of the precious minerals the west is interested in now falls within Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. Having 50% of the rights to Ukraine's rare earth is not all that great, given this reality**. There is no guarantee that Ukraine will win the war (or when), nor is there a guarantee they will ever regain the territory.** Meanwhile, the US would presumably continue to pump money into Ukraine with no end in sight? Trump isn't going to be OK with that. I think he is working out a post-war deal with Russia that makes certain that minerals will be available immediately.\n\n**Part III: Positions**\n\nWhere to invest? Well, Techmet is private. However, there are still plays that can be made in this sector. Right now I have \\~$250,000 in derivatives and stock opened yesterday and today. Here is where I am at the moment, though I will absolutely re-balance as I continue to do research.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oclseac8cjke1.jpg?width=665&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48232bf2a19ed448757da6cc248dee2453ae6faa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nznu3bc8cjke1.jpg?width=690&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=22a30e2408d70fb47c95264a4a8137c11402d7d1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/am8i3ac8cjke1.jpg?width=671&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ca74d99bd71812608bbe3a7bcbe1c4779e5c156\n\nWhy did I pick these? (don't mind Humana or Uber)\n\n>**MP materials** is presently the only rare earth mine and processor in the United States.\n\n>**LYS** is AU but part of \"The Quad\" that Trump opens the door for investments towards when he writes \"(k) The Secretary of State shall consider opportunities to advance the mining and processing of minerals within the United States through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.\"\n\n>**REEMF** is self-explanatory, rare earth exploration\n\n>**CAT**  is at a 6 month low. I thought that this was a good time to get in given ramping of mining in future. They have ties to Ukraine's post-war rebuilding via the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council (USUBC).\n\n>**TSLA** (not pictured; getting calls Monday) as Elon Musk is close with Trump and shares concern over lithium in particular. TSLA has [just launched operations in a lithium processing plant in TX as well](https://cen.acs.org/energy/energy-storage-/Tesla-begins-making-lithium-chemicals/102/web/2024/12#:~:text=Credit:%20Tesla,lithium%20production%20in%20the%20US) and I would not be surprised to see substantial federal funding in the short term and medium term. See [also this article.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/where-does-tesla-get-its-lithium)\n\n>**UUUU** is largely uranium although they are branching out. I'm bullish on it because of this language: \"(c)  The Secretary of the Interior shall instruct the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey to consider updating the Survey’s list of critical minerals, including for the potential of including uranium.\"\n\n>**IPX** up-and-coming titanium processing w/ a special patent.\n\n>**Other ideas:** Talon Metals (nickel, partnered with TSLA);  ABAT, Holtec, anything having to do with Brazilian Nickel or General Atomics; anything related to the Quad countries and rare earth / metals. I would welcome other suggestions regarding investments that get the right kind of exposure.\n\nI'll close with this. Brian Menell, after meeting Mr. Zelensky in NY alongside other energy executives in September, had this to say in a statement:\n\n>“TechMet, together with our partners, is available to move forward with further work if the U.S. and Ukrainian governments instruct us to do so\"\n\nWestern interests will be ready at a moments notice. Will you be?",

We are talking new contracts week after week after week.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/srlxn6g8weke1.png?width=626&format=png&auto=webp&s=396635b4408c866ab77a3571771e993c9db90b14\n\nThis has resulted produced a smooth as butter compounding machine that has recently inflected to positive ebidtda.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/49f0wdblweke1.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bba22e008adc454b1a6bc6f9731ede73b71897b\n\nAs far as valuation goes, it stacks of pretty damn nice. For example, far better grow and lower ev / sales multiple compared to it's closest peer PL.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o0wzghh2xeke1.png?width=424&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa27eef224ebe52a3ac67bfde8c6bf4e03384765\n\nBack in the day they had a strategic partnership with PLTR. Not notably sure if it is still ongoing: \n\n[https://www.blacksky.com/blacksky-secures-investment-from-palantir-and-enters-into-multi-year-strategic-partnership-following-successful-pilot-project/](https://www.blacksky.com/blacksky-secures-investment-from-palantir-and-enters-into-multi-year-strategic-partnership-following-successful-pilot-project/)\n\n  \nIn sum, I think BKSY occupies a really interesting niche (high res, low latency imagery) that will likely be able to command really nice margins over time. And they have the benefit of a good liquidity and positive growth, so probably don't need to worry about being hammered by financing - as is the typical case with satellite companies - all that much.\n\nI am rolling with a good slug of commons, and some calls for extra juice.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/llssghcjxeke1.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=62ab5baedaff593425123cb81df6e6a7e161311b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sgxu3qrmxeke1.png?width=339&format=png&auto=webp&s=75a23bf587474d8ab210950f7d804fb998764bee\n\n",

Then you gotta be a big boy and heed what I’m about to say.\n\nTime to take some accountability.\n\n You have achieved peak regard using money you need to gamble on the stock market. It is genuinely the same as putting your mortgage money on the roulette table. I’m hoping that your wife knew what you were doing but I’m assuming that if she did she didn’t know the risk factor. Or she didn’t know what you were doing with joint money, which is worse.\n\nMy genuine advice is to open up. Let her know you fucked up, and take ownership. PLTR may recover but regardless of what it does or doesn’t do, you gotta be transparent with your wife. If she didn’t know you were doing this, you will have an infinitely more manageable position than if she finds out on her own. Idk your wife, and don’t know how she’ll react, but my wife always says (and lives out) that she would rather I be honest about my fuck ups than lying to her and hiding. \n\nI wish you well as you navigate this bro. You are in fight or flight. Use that ascended primate brain to get yourself centered and make a genuine plan. And tell your wife lol.\n\nGood luck!",

I’m not taking about over values hype stocks like PLTR. \n\nWe saw an 8% decrease in the market over a 6 month period during the first batch of Trump tariffs and are up over 100% since then.

When China started imposing critical minerals ban a while back, I was informed to think about this market, but hesitated as I had little understanding of the market dynamics and its broader impetus.\n\nI think this is a Long game. We're unlikely to see short-term price upsurge, and even if it does, it'll be unsustainable. Expect volatility before a major breakout, which occurs when key milestones showing US-allied partnership production scaling. If short-term upsurge does occur, those relevant equities you mentioned won't be moved by fundamental analysis (productive capacity & growth takes time), but by geopoltical & regulatory hype.\n\nAlso forgot to mention: caution on allied matters. Australia is very likely to use these resources as bargaining chip with US, given recent strained ties/tariffs. I do expect Aus govt to revert back to an American lapdog trying to prove its loyalty, which it has done time and again, but getting the resource won't come that easy.\n\nPositions: \n- Aus: LYC (already secured Pentagon contract), ASM (potential US supplier), ILU LRV HAS BRE (undeveloped/ waiting), \n- US: PPTA (DOD fund), MP (Pentagon & GM), UAMY (secured govt, secured partnerships with US allies like Thailand, no new contract/funding but high potential)",

If you live in Southern California it might seem great, but the nation is vast.  And much of that vastness has no recharging stations among large populations.  People still desire ICE vehicles and probably will for the near to mid future.\n\nYet it will be interesting to see the true reliability reports of those cars, if they ever see light of day.  \n\nThe other aspect is manufacturer support... \n\nAnd just remember more tech means more things to get outdated and/or break.  Short term it shows great for reviews, but long term is what really matters.  So I remain skeptical of your claim..

I also bought $PL for the same reason. Both of these companies have since either won or been approved as a major vendor for government global imaging projects. \n\n\nI heard of them while chatting with chatgpt about companies in the space sector that are hoarding data. These two companies seemed like major players in this game. $PL I'm actually shocked hasn't gone up as much given they have imaged the entire early every day for over a decade. The amount of data is wild. Though only recently do they seem to be utilizing this for military applications when previously it was mostly aimed at climate change.\n\n\nKeep in mind, I also bought TEM based on this. A lot of my insanely profitable plays over the last couple months have been trying to identify which companies can utilize the next stage for AI, which is piles of data, and which companies are already set in their field to continue to do so. Once I heard BKSY was going up with RKLB, I bought more and have continued to do so.\n\n\nIf I'm being honest, I don't like seeing this on this sub lol. It'll turn into a pump and dump but I legitimately like the company. I'd prefer if people piled in, you all paced yourselves so I could save myself the emotional turmoil I'm currently in with TEM lol.",

It's not on the chopping block with the doge cuts.\n\nEstimated $1.8T growth opportunity in space.\n\nMaxar is the only other company that beats BlackSky on image resolution (barely), but BlackSky beats them on revisit times and AI/software.

      "comment_body": "For people that do not understand options trading:\n\nTrade Type: The regard executed a trade involving Put options on Palantir Technologies ($PLTR).\n\nQuantity: Regard traded 1,000 put contracts\n\nStrike Price: The $95 put expiring on February 23, 2025.\n\nInvestment (Cost Basis): The regard paid $0.47 per contract (multiplied by 1000 contracts and then 100 shares per contract). This would total $64,000.\n\nExit Price: The put options were sold at $0.65, which means he gained a small increase per contract.\n\nProfit: The regard made $16,773.42 from the trade in a short span of 7 minutes.\n\nDownside Risk\n\nWhile the upside resulted in a quick profit, the downside risk was substantial:\n\n1. Max Loss (if the trade went wrong)\nSince he was trading put options, the worst-case scenario would be the put contracts losing all value (expiring worthless).\n\nIf Palantir's stock price rose sharply or remained stable, the puts could have lost value rapidly.\nThe full investment of $64,000 could have been lost if the stock moved against them over time.\n\n2. Liquidity and Execution Risk\nWith a large trade (1,000 contracts), any slippage (difference between expected price and execution price) could erode gains or magnify losses.\n\nIf the regard couldn't exit quickly, the position could swing negatively.\n\n3. Theta Decay (Time Decay)\nSince options lose value over time, holding too long would have exposed him to depreciation risks if volatility dropped or if Palantir's stock price did not move in favor of the put position.\n\n4. Underlying Stock Risk\nIf $PLTR's stock price rose instead of falling, the put option would decline in value, leading to a loss.\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n1. The regard risked $64,000 for a $16,773 gain in 7 minutes.\n2. The max downside was potentially losing all $64,000 if the trade went against them.\n3.The strategy relied on short-term price movement, and the timing of entry/exit was crucial.\n4.If he had mistimed the exit, the profit could have been smaller, or the trade could have turned into a loss.",
