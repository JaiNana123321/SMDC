If and ehrn I need the remaining $$$ ill sell and take the loss. Its the game we play. But the reviews on their vehicles seem to be pretty damn good for the most part except for parts and maintenance. I also own Tesla stock.\n\nIn those years of owning stocks of 2 EV companies, customer demand has not been what the companies and market were thinking theyd be. Theres a reason\nFord\nGM\nHonda\nMB\nToyota\nVW\nVolvo\n\nHave scaled back production targets or POSTPONED building EVâ€™s.",
