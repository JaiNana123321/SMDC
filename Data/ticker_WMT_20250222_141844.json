We are at the tail end of the biggest bull market in history, and you think it‚Äôs going to go up even more because ‚Äúlow rates = stocks go up.‚Äù Every company from AMD and AMZN to XYZ and WMT is giving poor guidance because consumers don‚Äôt have any more spending money, and yet the dip is still being bought because regards have been conditioned to do so over the last couple years. Lowering rates and cutting government spending means stagflation ‚Äî we will see how much the market likes that!",
