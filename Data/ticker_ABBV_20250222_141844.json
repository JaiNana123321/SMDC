My mom has had to fight them twice for eczema medications and thankfully my dermatologist gave me samples to get me by until the insurance approved the prescription. ABBV even said they’d give me a 2 year supply for $5 a month and even had me call someone once a month to see how I was doing with it. Tbh as much as I wish we could have a German system where you could chose between state run and private health insurance, these motherfuckers are honestly pushing my view to being that we need to nationalize the healthcare system because the whole thing seems to be based on fucking over their customers and the government.",
