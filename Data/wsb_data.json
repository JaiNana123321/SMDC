          "selftext": "Hello Regards,\n\nDroneshield (DRO) is showing promising returns and WSB seems unaware. A quick search on google trends would make it seem that the USA are not aware of the stock at the moment. So here is a small DD to get this beauty of a company on your radar and not leave all the tendies to the Germans and Australians. \n\n  \nPlain and simple:\n\nDRO develops and sells anti-drone tech. DRO engineers, produces and maintains their own products. \n\nCostumers: EU countries that are ramping up their drone defense systems since Ukraine has demonstrated the dangers of drones. Countries neighboring China since they also can't keep their drones to themselves. South American countries that are trying to counter the use of drones by the drug cartels.\n\nAdded value: Their products protect and save lives.\n\n[Their revenue is ramping up with repeat orders by satisfied customers.](https://preview.redd.it/zp0bc0imhkke1.png?width=1058&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc4cd9e2d400ab64f4fdeee2bcf84c4b8293e514)\n\n.\n\n[They manage to maintain super healthy gross profit margins.](https://preview.redd.it/oy2dheyyhkke1.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfcdc462de4e6c547a8c3325948efb6256ba61bd)\n\n.\n\n[Net profit margin transitioned into the green. ](https://preview.redd.it/hrvdph1qikke1.png?width=1057&format=png&auto=webp&s=596bfe90e67ba299511afd52132c499501c31797)\n\nWhy is the net profit margin relatively low: 200 of their 255 employees are engineers that R&D this company to perfection. My guess is that this is quite expensive. Droneshield understands: great value comes from great products. And great products bring in great costumers.\n\n  \nHere is a page out of their latest earnings report. This update caused the reverse of the trend. It shows that their revenue spike was not a one off event but only the beginning of the profitable era. Read the full report here: [https://static1.squarespace.com/static/660a32624c94dd36e509baf3/t/67995f878b0b2b6c9b290038/1738104717089/4C\\_4Q24.pdf](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/660a32624c94dd36e509baf3/t/67995f878b0b2b6c9b290038/1738104717089/4C_4Q24.pdf)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7ow29x92okke1.png?width=633&format=png&auto=webp&s=26bcc8aedaa65b0100d586dfea9b91a4bdcb543b\n\nNegative: DRO takes on very little debt, to little. Instead they have gradually over the years sold more shares. I would say this should slow down now cash is coming in through sales. \n\n  \nFurthermore they maintain a very healthy balance sheet with 220 million cash balance. Check out their website. Its a piece of art on its own: [https://www.droneshield.com/investor-relations](https://www.droneshield.com/investor-relations)\n\n  \nMy humble position:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ikyzvcrqfkke1.png?width=1534&format=png&auto=webp&s=565d7e0a27412ff805ca54df26f64635d2263423\n\nI plan to stay in for the long run. But if it moons again like last time I will take profit and step back in when the dust settled. \n\nThere is a lot more to be said about this company. But I leave that for the discussion. I hope I have been of service to my fellow regards at WSB.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. No AI was used making this DD.

          "title": "the sector you've never touched IS a 10-bagger, but not like that [DD w/ $250k invested)",
          "selftext": "A few days ago, I saw the[ \\[DD\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ir0k5o/this_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_dd/) posted here about the mining industry. The OP of this post was right to point out that the mining sector is due for a massive run and I appreciated the attention they drew to the qualities of a high return opportunity.¬† However, their recommendation was mostly to invest in mining related to GOLD! Reading that was like watching one set the dining table beautifully, only to proceed to mistake the appetizer for the main dish.\n\nToday I‚Äôm going to provide further evidence for the case that the mining industry presents a massive opportunity on a timescale anywhere from right now to the end of Trump‚Äôs term. The investments that are going to make you rich, however, have nothing to do with gold, per se, and everything to do with titanium, lithium, rare earth minerals, and the complete market dominance China has over their processing and extraction.\n\n**Part I: Ukraine, Greenland, Russia, Cosmetic Moguls, and the Allied Supply Chain**\n\nWhy does Trump care so much about Greenland? Why is he so insistent on Ukraine signing away 50% of their claim to Ukraine‚Äôs minerals and, if that matters so much, why did he cut Ukraine out from the opening negotiations with Russia?\n\nThe answer is that it's all about the supply chain of minerals and metals. China is bending us over the table with their grip over the chain (80-90%+ dominance), especially in separation/processing of the materials. Recently, they [have gone as far as to ban key processing/separation materials needed](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-lithium-company-halts-tech-exports-trade-tensions-build-2025-02-18/), posturing to protect their interests in the face of American policy strides to distance themselves from their grip over the market. They have also kept costs of lithium and other precious earth and minerals artificially low, stymieing western incentive to establish their own supply chain.\n\n[China has been *SO* effective at doing all of this,](https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/china-dominant-mineral-mining-global-supply-chain-e2b7840e) that until the last few years, there was **ZERO** mining/processing of rare earth happening domestically in the USA. The picture wasn‚Äôt much better for other crucial metals and resources, such as lithium and titanium. We slept too long, took them for granted, and now here we are.\n\nDon‚Äôt understand the stakes? [Here is **Marco Rubio**](https://uscriticalmaterials.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Marco-Rubio-video.mp4), our present secretary of state and who has recently opened up peace negotiations with Russia over Ukraine, being an absolute doomer about the state of play with the supply chain. **Lindsey Graham -** another key Trump ally - also has eyes on the issue, especially as it pertains to Ukraine and what they may offer us for security (check out these tweets [here ](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1891046931323040187)and [here](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1799832487285465244)).\n\nLet me be clear that this is a bipartisan issue and it is *extremely* difficult to deny the threat this poses to our national security and economic prosperity (the previous administration came to the same conclusion). That is why it has been a priority of both administrations. However, this present iteration of the Trump administration is uniquely situated to set the market ablaze in ways that previous administrations could not.\n\n**Part II. Convergence, Timing, Trump Administration, Private Equity, Executive Action**\n\nAlright, so we have established that the US is seriously threatened by China‚Äôs stranglehold over this sector. What is this administration doing and who are the relevant people involved? I don‚Äôt have time to give you all of the reasons that point me in favor of a bullish sentiment on titanium, lithium, and rare earth minerals. Here are a few that I take to be really supportive, however.\n\nFirst, let me introduce you to **Ronald S. Lauder**, heir to the Est√©e Lauder cosmetics company. For whatever reason, this guy has a real penchant for minerals and mining. He is [*close friends* with Donald Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/trump-ukraine-rare-earth-minerals.html) and is, according to the NY times, the one that initially led Trump to turn his attention to Greenland. He is also very interested in Ukrainian minerals and metals.\n\nYou see, Ronald Lauder is a business partner of **Brian Menell**, CEO of private investment/equity firm [**Techmet**](https://www.techmet.com/), which seeks to expand production of precious minerals across our global assets to help ensure a secure and sustainable supply of the key metals for western-aligned interests.\n\nIf there is one company to look at and one company alone, it is Techmet. Recently, they have secured 180 million from **QIA**. They are **DOE and DFC** contractors with extremely lucrative deals over the last few years. Furthermore, what makes them unusual is that the DFC decided against their usual financing terms and actually went ahead and bought a direct stake in Techmet itself. That means the **US Federal Government** is a stakeholder directly aligned with the interests and priorities of Techmet.¬†\n\nAs if this was not enough, Techmet also has the investment/backing of energy behemoth Mercuria. They also hold advisory members and business partners from big name mining companies like Rio Tinto. Furthermore, their current chairman is **Admiral Mike Mullen** who was previously Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, as well as on the board of **General Motors. S**uffice to say that their present reach and influence over western government is compelling as anything I have ever seen before.¬†\n\nIf you are curious, here is the CEO Brian Menell two or so weeks ago discussing the present state of the administration and supply chain issues [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP9_PY5gEug&ab_channel=SmarterMarkets%E2%84%A2) He is bullish about this administration and highlights what needs to happen in order to compete with China effectively.¬†\n\nWhat does he stress? **Permitting, Bureaucracy Reform, Federal Incentivization.** He calls on the administration to lift regulations, give permits quickly, purchase directly and invest in western-aligned companies that are working on the energy transition. Trump is doing *exactly* this, from establishing the sovereign wealth fund, to the guidance issued by way of two executive actions ‚Äú[Unleashing American Energy‚Äù](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/), as well as¬† [‚ÄúUnleashing Prosperity through Deregulation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-prosperity-through-deregulation/).‚Äù\n\nI recommend you read the language, especially Section 9 of the executive order on energy. The order seeks to ‚Äúestablish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states‚Äù as well as ‚Äúto protect the United States' economic and national security and military preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation‚Äù\n\nBy way of the executive orders, federal agencies are instructed (within 60 days) to identify and eliminate barriers to efficient private investment and reduce project timelines for critical energy. Trump also instructs that priority should be placed on making sure USA funds critical mineral ventures and he also instructs to make sure the USA has an adequate stockpile of critical minerals/metals (and to purchase more if not). Emphasis is also placed on geologic mapping, and key western partnerships that share national¬† security interests, called the **‚ÄúQuad.‚Äù** If you are interested in further reading on this last point, I recommend[ this article ](https://www.orfonline.org/research/the-case-for-a-quad-mineral-security-partnership#_edn81)on Quadrilateral Mineral Partnerships.\n\nHere is another item in the order on Unleashing American Energy:\n\n>(j) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy that includes policy recommendations to enhance the competitiveness of American mining and refining companies in other mineral-wealthy nations.\n\nTrump is not a patient man. He will act quickly after receiving this report in March and he is already trying his best to wrap up Ukraine as quickly as possible too with assurances of mineral access. That's why I believe the shortest timeline to return is now to the end of Trump's term.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that Trump's team began negotiations without Ukraine precisely because they are seeking to get the best minerals deal possible. Russian advances on Ukraine have meant that many of the precious minerals the west is interested in now falls within Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. Having 50% of the rights to Ukraine's rare earth is not all that great, given this reality**. There is no guarantee that Ukraine will win the war (or when), nor is there a guarantee they will ever regain the territory.** Meanwhile, the US would presumably continue to pump money into Ukraine with no end in sight? Trump isn't going to be OK with that. I think he is working out a post-war deal with Russia that makes certain that minerals will be available immediately.\n\n**Part III: Positions**\n\nWhere to invest? Well, Techmet is private. However, there are still plays that can be made in this sector. Right now I have \\~$250,000 in derivatives and stock opened yesterday and today. Here is where I am at the moment, though I will absolutely re-balance as I continue to do research.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oclseac8cjke1.jpg?width=665&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48232bf2a19ed448757da6cc248dee2453ae6faa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nznu3bc8cjke1.jpg?width=690&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=22a30e2408d70fb47c95264a4a8137c11402d7d1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/am8i3ac8cjke1.jpg?width=671&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ca74d99bd71812608bbe3a7bcbe1c4779e5c156\n\nWhy did I pick these? (don't mind Humana or Uber)\n\n>**MP materials** is presently the only rare earth mine and processor in the United States.\n\n>**LYS** is AU but part of \"The Quad\" that Trump opens the door for investments towards when he writes \"(k) The Secretary of State shall consider opportunities to advance the mining and processing of minerals within the United States through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.\"\n\n>**REEMF** is self-explanatory, rare earth exploration\n\n>**CAT**  is at a 6 month low. I thought that this was a good time to get in given ramping of mining in future. They have ties to Ukraine's post-war rebuilding via the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council (USUBC).\n\n>**TSLA** (not pictured; getting calls Monday) as Elon Musk is close with Trump and shares concern over lithium in particular. TSLA has [just launched operations in a lithium processing plant in TX as well](https://cen.acs.org/energy/energy-storage-/Tesla-begins-making-lithium-chemicals/102/web/2024/12#:~:text=Credit:%20Tesla,lithium%20production%20in%20the%20US) and I would not be surprised to see substantial federal funding in the short term and medium term. See [also this article.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/where-does-tesla-get-its-lithium)\n\n>**UUUU** is largely uranium although they are branching out. I'm bullish on it because of this language: \"(c) ¬†The Secretary of the Interior shall instruct the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey to consider updating the Survey‚Äôs list of critical minerals, including for the potential of including uranium.\"\n\n>**IPX** up-and-coming titanium processing w/ a special patent.\n\n>**Other ideas:** Talon Metals (nickel, partnered with TSLA);  ABAT, Holtec, anything having to do with Brazilian Nickel or General Atomics; anything related to the Quad countries and rare earth / metals. I would welcome other suggestions regarding investments that get the right kind of exposure.\n\nI'll close with this. Brian Menell, after meeting Mr. Zelensky in NY alongside other energy executives in September, had this to say in a statement:\n\n>‚ÄúTechMet, together with our partners, is available to move forward with further work if the U.S. and Ukrainian governments instruct us to do so\"\n\nWestern interests will be ready at a moments notice. Will you be?",

Yesterday they successfully put the first of Gen-3 satellites into orbit with the help of Rocket Lab.\n\n[https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-successfully-launches-60th-electron-first-of-multiple-missions-for-blacksky/](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-successfully-launches-60th-electron-first-of-multiple-missions-for-blacksky/)\n\nThe Gen-3 boasts an impressive step up vs Gen-2.

We are talking new contracts week after week after week.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/srlxn6g8weke1.png?width=626&format=png&auto=webp&s=396635b4408c866ab77a3571771e993c9db90b14\n\nThis has resulted produced a smooth as butter compounding machine that has recently inflected to positive ebidtda.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/49f0wdblweke1.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bba22e008adc454b1a6bc6f9731ede73b71897b\n\nAs far as valuation goes, it stacks of pretty damn nice.

And they have the benefit of a good liquidity and positive growth, so probably don't need to worry about being hammered by financing - as is the typical case with satellite companies - all that much.\n\nI am rolling with a good slug of commons, and some calls for extra juice.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/llssghcjxeke1.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=62ab5baedaff593425123cb81df6e6a7e161311b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sgxu3qrmxeke1.png?width=339&format=png&auto=webp&s=75a23bf587474d8ab210950f7d804fb998764bee\n\n",

We're unlikely to see short-term price upsurge, and even if it does, it'll be unsustainable. Expect volatility before a major breakout, which occurs when key milestones showing US-allied partnership production scaling. If short-term upsurge does occur, those relevant equities you mentioned won't be moved by fundamental analysis (productive capacity & growth takes time), but by geopoltical & regulatory hype.\n\nAlso forgot to mention: caution on allied matters. Australia is very likely to use these resources as bargaining chip with US, given recent strained ties/tariffs. I do expect Aus govt to revert back to an American lapdog trying to prove its loyalty, which it has done time and again, but getting the resource won't come that easy.\n\nPositions: \n- Aus: LYC (already secured Pentagon contract), ASM (potential US supplier), ILU LRV HAS BRE (undeveloped/ waiting), \n- US: PPTA (DOD fund), MP (Pentagon & GM), UAMY (secured govt, secured partnerships with US allies like Thailand, no new contract/funding but high potential)",

They couldn't come up with competitive ICE designs, but EVs are a lot easier for them.\n\nIn the US, at least, the recharging infrastructure is terrible.  If you live in Southern California it might seem great, but the nation is vast.  And much of that vastness has no recharging stations among large populations.  People still desire ICE vehicles and probably will for the near to mid future.\n\nYet it will be interesting to see the true reliability reports of those cars, if they ever see light of day.  \n\nThe other aspect is manufacturer support... \n\nAnd just remember more tech means more things to get outdated and/or break.  Short term it shows great for reviews, but long term is what really matters.  So I remain skeptical of your claim..  Just because the car was impressive to you doesn't mean it is going to resonate with others, who have other considerations beyond being geeked out from all the tech.",

I also bought $PL for the same reason. Both of these companies have since either won or been approved as a major vendor for government global imaging projects. \n\n\nI heard of them while chatting with chatgpt about companies in the space sector that are hoarding data. These two companies seemed like major players in this game. $PL I'm actually shocked hasn't gone up as much given they have imaged the entire early every day for over a decade. The amount of data is wild. Though only recently do they seem to be utilizing this for military applications when previously it was mostly aimed at climate change.\n\n\nKeep in mind, I also bought TEM based on this. A lot of my insanely profitable plays over the last couple months have been trying to identify which companies can utilize the next stage for AI, which is piles of data, and which companies are already set in their field to continue to do so. Once I heard BKSY was going up with RKLB, I bought more and have continued to do so.\n\n\nIf I'm being honest, I don't like seeing this on this sub lol. It'll turn into a pump and dump but I legitimately like the company. I'd prefer if people piled in, you all paced yourselves so I could save myself the emotional turmoil I'm currently in with TEM lol.",

This would total $64,000.\n\nExit Price: The put options were sold at $0.65, which means he gained a small increase per contract.\n\nProfit: The regard made $16,773.42 from the trade in a short span of 7 minutes.\n\nDownside Risk\n\nWhile the upside resulted in a quick profit, the downside risk was substantial:\n\n1. Max Loss (if the trade went wrong)\nSince he was trading put options, the worst-case scenario would be the put contracts losing all value (expiring worthless).\n\nIf Palantir's stock price rose sharply or remained stable, the puts could have lost value rapidly.\nThe full investment of $64,000 could have been lost if the stock moved against them over time.\n\n2. Liquidity and Execution Risk\nWith a large trade (1,000 contracts), any slippage (difference between expected price and execution price) could erode gains or magnify losses.\n\nIf the regard couldn't exit quickly, the position could swing negatively.\n\n3. Theta Decay (Time Decay)\nSince options lose value over time, holding too long would have exposed him to depreciation risks if volatility dropped or if Palantir's stock price did not move in favor of the put position.\n\n4. Underlying Stock Risk\nIf $PLTR's stock price rose instead of falling, the put option would decline in value, leading to a loss.\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n1. The regard risked $64,000 for a $16,773 gain in 7 minutes.\n2. The max downside was potentially losing all $64,000 if the trade went against them.\n3.The strategy relied on short-term price movement, and the timing of entry/exit was crucial.\n4.If he had mistimed the exit, the profit could have been smaller, or the trade could have turned into a loss.",

This would total $64,000.\n\nExit Price: The put options were sold at $0.65, which means he gained a small increase per contract.\n\nProfit: The regard made $16,773.42 from the trade in a short span of 7 minutes.\n\nDownside Risk\n\nWhile the upside resulted in a quick profit, the downside risk was substantial:\n\n1. Max Loss (if the trade went wrong)\nSince he was trading put options, the worst-case scenario would be the put contracts losing all value (expiring worthless).\n\nIf Palantir's stock price rose sharply or remained stable, the puts could have lost value rapidly.\nThe full investment of $64,000 could have been lost if the stock moved against them over time.\n\n2. Liquidity and Execution Risk\nWith a large trade (1,000 contracts), any slippage (difference between expected price and execution price) could erode gains or magnify losses.\n\nIf the regard couldn't exit quickly, the position could swing negatively.\n\n3. Theta Decay (Time Decay)\nSince options lose value over time, holding too long would have exposed him to depreciation risks if volatility dropped or if Palantir's stock price did not move in favor of the put position.\n\n4. Underlying Stock Risk\nIf $PLTR's stock price rose instead of falling, the put option would decline in value, leading to a loss.\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n1.

          "selftext": "Hello Regards,\n\nDroneshield (DRO) is showing promising returns and WSB seems unaware. A quick search on google trends would make it seem that the USA are not aware of the stock at the moment. So here is a small DD to get this beauty of a company on your radar and not leave all the tendies to the Germans and Australians. \n\n  \nPlain and simple:\n\nDRO develops and sells anti-drone tech. DRO engineers, produces and maintains their own products. \n\nCostumers: EU countries that are ramping up their drone defense systems since Ukraine has demonstrated the dangers of drones. Countries neighboring China since they also can't keep their drones to themselves. South American countries that are trying to counter the use of drones by the drug cartels.\n\nAdded value: Their products protect and save lives.\n\n[Their revenue is ramping up with repeat orders by satisfied customers.](https://preview.redd.it/zp0bc0imhkke1.png?width=1058&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc4cd9e2d400ab64f4fdeee2bcf84c4b8293e514)\n\n.\n\n[They manage to maintain super healthy gross profit margins.](https://preview.redd.it/oy2dheyyhkke1.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfcdc462de4e6c547a8c3325948efb6256ba61bd)\n\n.\n\n[Net profit margin transitioned into the green. ](https://preview.redd.it/hrvdph1qikke1.png?width=1057&format=png&auto=webp&s=596bfe90e67ba299511afd52132c499501c31797)\n\nWhy is the net profit margin relatively low: 200 of their 255 employees are engineers that R&D this company to perfection. My guess is that this is quite expensive. Droneshield understands: great value comes from great products. And great products bring in great costumers.\n\n  \nHere is a page out of their latest earnings report. This update caused the reverse of the trend. It shows that their revenue spike was not a one off event but only the beginning of the profitable era. Read the full report here: [https://static1.squarespace.com/static/660a32624c94dd36e509baf3/t/67995f878b0b2b6c9b290038/1738104717089/4C\\_4Q24.pdf](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/660a32624c94dd36e509baf3/t/67995f878b0b2b6c9b290038/1738104717089/4C_4Q24.pdf)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7ow29x92okke1.png?width=633&format=png&auto=webp&s=26bcc8aedaa65b0100d586dfea9b91a4bdcb543b\n\nNegative: DRO takes on very little debt, to little. Instead they have gradually over the years sold more shares. I would say this should slow down now cash is coming in through sales. \n\n  \nFurthermore they maintain a very healthy balance sheet with 220 million cash balance. Check out their website. Its a piece of art on its own: [https://www.droneshield.com/investor-relations](https://www.droneshield.com/investor-relations)\n\n  \nMy humble position:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ikyzvcrqfkke1.png?width=1534&format=png&auto=webp&s=565d7e0a27412ff805ca54df26f64635d2263423\n\nI plan to stay in for the long run. But if it moons again like last time I will take profit and step back in when the dust settled. \n\nThere is a lot more to be said about this company. But I leave that for the discussion. I hope I have been of service to my fellow regards at WSB.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. No AI was used making this DD.

          "selftext": "A few days ago, I saw the[ \\[DD\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ir0k5o/this_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_dd/) posted here about the mining industry. The OP of this post was right to point out that the mining sector is due for a massive run and I appreciated the attention they drew to the qualities of a high return opportunity.¬† However, their recommendation was mostly to invest in mining related to GOLD! Reading that was like watching one set the dining table beautifully, only to proceed to mistake the appetizer for the main dish.\n\nToday I‚Äôm going to provide further evidence for the case that the mining industry presents a massive opportunity on a timescale anywhere from right now to the end of Trump‚Äôs term. The investments that are going to make you rich, however, have nothing to do with gold, per se, and everything to do with titanium, lithium, rare earth minerals, and the complete market dominance China has over their processing and extraction.\n\n**Part I: Ukraine, Greenland, Russia, Cosmetic Moguls, and the Allied Supply Chain**\n\nWhy does Trump care so much about Greenland? Why is he so insistent on Ukraine signing away 50% of their claim to Ukraine‚Äôs minerals and, if that matters so much, why did he cut Ukraine out from the opening negotiations with Russia?\n\nThe answer is that it's all about the supply chain of minerals and metals. China is bending us over the table with their grip over the chain (80-90%+ dominance), especially in separation/processing of the materials. Recently, they [have gone as far as to ban key processing/separation materials needed](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-lithium-company-halts-tech-exports-trade-tensions-build-2025-02-18/), posturing to protect their interests in the face of American policy strides to distance themselves from their grip over the market. They have also kept costs of lithium and other precious earth and minerals artificially low, stymieing western incentive to establish their own supply chain.\n\n[China has been *SO* effective at doing all of this,](https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/china-dominant-mineral-mining-global-supply-chain-e2b7840e) that until the last few years, there was **ZERO** mining/processing of rare earth happening domestically in the USA. The picture wasn‚Äôt much better for other crucial metals and resources, such as lithium and titanium. We slept too long, took them for granted, and now here we are.\n\nDon‚Äôt understand the stakes? [Here is **Marco Rubio**](https://uscriticalmaterials.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Marco-Rubio-video.mp4), our present secretary of state and who has recently opened up peace negotiations with Russia over Ukraine, being an absolute doomer about the state of play with the supply chain. **Lindsey Graham -** another key Trump ally - also has eyes on the issue, especially as it pertains to Ukraine and what they may offer us for security (check out these tweets [here ](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1891046931323040187)and [here](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1799832487285465244)).\n\nLet me be clear that this is a bipartisan issue and it is *extremely* difficult to deny the threat this poses to our national security and economic prosperity (the previous administration came to the same conclusion). That is why it has been a priority of both administrations. However, this present iteration of the Trump administration is uniquely situated to set the market ablaze in ways that previous administrations could not.\n\n**Part II. Convergence, Timing, Trump Administration, Private Equity, Executive Action**\n\nAlright, so we have established that the US is seriously threatened by China‚Äôs stranglehold over this sector. What is this administration doing and who are the relevant people involved? I don‚Äôt have time to give you all of the reasons that point me in favor of a bullish sentiment on titanium, lithium, and rare earth minerals. Here are a few that I take to be really supportive, however.\n\nFirst, let me introduce you to **Ronald S. Lauder**, heir to the Est√©e Lauder cosmetics company. For whatever reason, this guy has a real penchant for minerals and mining. He is [*close friends* with Donald Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/trump-ukraine-rare-earth-minerals.html) and is, according to the NY times, the one that initially led Trump to turn his attention to Greenland. He is also very interested in Ukrainian minerals and metals.\n\nYou see, Ronald Lauder is a business partner of **Brian Menell**, CEO of private investment/equity firm [**Techmet**](https://www.techmet.com/), which seeks to expand production of precious minerals across our global assets to help ensure a secure and sustainable supply of the key metals for western-aligned interests.\n\nIf there is one company to look at and one company alone, it is Techmet. Recently, they have secured 180 million from **QIA**. They are **DOE and DFC** contractors with extremely lucrative deals over the last few years. Furthermore, what makes them unusual is that the DFC decided against their usual financing terms and actually went ahead and bought a direct stake in Techmet itself. That means the **US Federal Government** is a stakeholder directly aligned with the interests and priorities of Techmet.¬†\n\nAs if this was not enough, Techmet also has the investment/backing of energy behemoth Mercuria. They also hold advisory members and business partners from big name mining companies like Rio Tinto. Furthermore, their current chairman is **Admiral Mike Mullen** who was previously Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, as well as on the board of **General Motors. S**uffice to say that their present reach and influence over western government is compelling as anything I have ever seen before.¬†\n\nIf you are curious, here is the CEO Brian Menell two or so weeks ago discussing the present state of the administration and supply chain issues [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP9_PY5gEug&ab_channel=SmarterMarkets%E2%84%A2) He is bullish about this administration and highlights what needs to happen in order to compete with China effectively.¬†\n\nWhat does he stress? **Permitting, Bureaucracy Reform, Federal Incentivization.** He calls on the administration to lift regulations, give permits quickly, purchase directly and invest in western-aligned companies that are working on the energy transition. Trump is doing *exactly* this, from establishing the sovereign wealth fund, to the guidance issued by way of two executive actions ‚Äú[Unleashing American Energy‚Äù](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/), as well as¬† [‚ÄúUnleashing Prosperity through Deregulation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-prosperity-through-deregulation/).‚Äù\n\nI recommend you read the language, especially Section 9 of the executive order on energy. The order seeks to ‚Äúestablish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states‚Äù as well as ‚Äúto protect the United States' economic and national security and military preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation‚Äù\n\nBy way of the executive orders, federal agencies are instructed (within 60 days) to identify and eliminate barriers to efficient private investment and reduce project timelines for critical energy. Trump also instructs that priority should be placed on making sure USA funds critical mineral ventures and he also instructs to make sure the USA has an adequate stockpile of critical minerals/metals (and to purchase more if not). Emphasis is also placed on geologic mapping, and key western partnerships that share national¬† security interests, called the **‚ÄúQuad.‚Äù** If you are interested in further reading on this last point, I recommend[ this article ](https://www.orfonline.org/research/the-case-for-a-quad-mineral-security-partnership#_edn81)on Quadrilateral Mineral Partnerships.\n\nHere is another item in the order on Unleashing American Energy:\n\n>(j) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy that includes policy recommendations to enhance the competitiveness of American mining and refining companies in other mineral-wealthy nations.\n\nTrump is not a patient man. He will act quickly after receiving this report in March and he is already trying his best to wrap up Ukraine as quickly as possible too with assurances of mineral access. That's why I believe the shortest timeline to return is now to the end of Trump's term.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that Trump's team began negotiations without Ukraine precisely because they are seeking to get the best minerals deal possible. Russian advances on Ukraine have meant that many of the precious minerals the west is interested in now falls within Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. Having 50% of the rights to Ukraine's rare earth is not all that great, given this reality**. There is no guarantee that Ukraine will win the war (or when), nor is there a guarantee they will ever regain the territory.** Meanwhile, the US would presumably continue to pump money into Ukraine with no end in sight? Trump isn't going to be OK with that. I think he is working out a post-war deal with Russia that makes certain that minerals will be available immediately.\n\n**Part III: Positions**\n\nWhere to invest? Well, Techmet is private. However, there are still plays that can be made in this sector. Right now I have \\~$250,000 in derivatives and stock opened yesterday and today. Here is where I am at the moment, though I will absolutely re-balance as I continue to do research.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oclseac8cjke1.jpg?width=665&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48232bf2a19ed448757da6cc248dee2453ae6faa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nznu3bc8cjke1.jpg?width=690&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=22a30e2408d70fb47c95264a4a8137c11402d7d1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/am8i3ac8cjke1.jpg?width=671&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ca74d99bd71812608bbe3a7bcbe1c4779e5c156\n\nWhy did I pick these? (don't mind Humana or Uber)\n\n>**MP materials** is presently the only rare earth mine and processor in the United States.\n\n>**LYS** is AU but part of \"The Quad\" that Trump opens the door for investments towards when he writes \"(k) The Secretary of State shall consider opportunities to advance the mining and processing of minerals within the United States through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.\"\n\n>**REEMF** is self-explanatory, rare earth exploration\n\n>**CAT**  is at a 6 month low. I thought that this was a good time to get in given ramping of mining in future. They have ties to Ukraine's post-war rebuilding via the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council (USUBC).\n\n>**TSLA** (not pictured; getting calls Monday) as Elon Musk is close with Trump and shares concern over lithium in particular. TSLA has [just launched operations in a lithium processing plant in TX as well](https://cen.acs.org/energy/energy-storage-/Tesla-begins-making-lithium-chemicals/102/web/2024/12#:~:text=Credit:%20Tesla,lithium%20production%20in%20the%20US) and I would not be surprised to see substantial federal funding in the short term and medium term. See [also this article.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/where-does-tesla-get-its-lithium)\n\n>**UUUU** is largely uranium although they are branching out. I'm bullish on it because of this language: \"(c) ¬†The Secretary of the Interior shall instruct the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey to consider updating the Survey‚Äôs list of critical minerals, including for the potential of including uranium.\"\n\n>**IPX** up-and-coming titanium processing w/ a special patent.\n\n>**Other ideas:** Talon Metals (nickel, partnered with TSLA);  ABAT, Holtec, anything having to do with Brazilian Nickel or General Atomics; anything related to the Quad countries and rare earth / metals. I would welcome other suggestions regarding investments that get the right kind of exposure.\n\nI'll close with this. Brian Menell, after meeting Mr. Zelensky in NY alongside other energy executives in September, had this to say in a statement:\n\n>‚ÄúTechMet, together with our partners, is available to move forward with further work if the U.S. and Ukrainian governments instruct us to do so\"\n\nWestern interests will be ready at a moments notice. Will you be?",

I also bought $PL for the same reason. Both of these companies have since either won or been approved as a major vendor for government global imaging projects. \n\n\nI heard of them while chatting with chatgpt about companies in the space sector that are hoarding data. These two companies seemed like major players in this game. $PL I'm actually shocked hasn't gone up as much given they have imaged the entire early every day for over a decade. The amount of data is wild. Though only recently do they seem to be utilizing this for military applications when previously it was mostly aimed at climate change.\n\n\nKeep in mind, I also bought TEM based on this. A lot of my insanely profitable plays over the last couple months have been trying to identify which companies can utilize the next stage for AI, which is piles of data, and which companies are already set in their field to continue to do so. Once I heard BKSY was going up with RKLB, I bought more and have continued to do so.\n\n\nIf I'm being honest, I don't like seeing this on this sub lol.

          "selftext": "Hello Regards,\n\nDroneshield (DRO) is showing promising returns and WSB seems unaware. A quick search on google trends would make it seem that the USA are not aware of the stock at the moment. So here is a small DD to get this beauty of a company on your radar and not leave all the tendies to the Germans and Australians. \n\n  \nPlain and simple:\n\nDRO develops and sells anti-drone tech. DRO engineers, produces and maintains their own products. \n\nCostumers: EU countries that are ramping up their drone defense systems since Ukraine has demonstrated the dangers of drones. Countries neighboring China since they also can't keep their drones to themselves. South American countries that are trying to counter the use of drones by the drug cartels.\n\nAdded value: Their products protect and save lives.\n\n[Their revenue is ramping up with repeat orders by satisfied customers.](https://preview.redd.it/zp0bc0imhkke1.png?width=1058&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc4cd9e2d400ab64f4fdeee2bcf84c4b8293e514)\n\n.\n\n[They manage to maintain super healthy gross profit margins.](https://preview.redd.it/oy2dheyyhkke1.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfcdc462de4e6c547a8c3325948efb6256ba61bd)\n\n.\n\n[Net profit margin transitioned into the green. ](https://preview.redd.it/hrvdph1qikke1.png?width=1057&format=png&auto=webp&s=596bfe90e67ba299511afd52132c499501c31797)\n\nWhy is the net profit margin relatively low: 200 of their 255 employees are engineers that R&D this company to perfection. My guess is that this is quite expensive. Droneshield understands: great value comes from great products. And great products bring in great costumers.\n\n  \nHere is a page out of their latest earnings report. This update caused the reverse of the trend. It shows that their revenue spike was not a one off event but only the beginning of the profitable era. Read the full report here: [https://static1.squarespace.com/static/660a32624c94dd36e509baf3/t/67995f878b0b2b6c9b290038/1738104717089/4C\\_4Q24.pdf](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/660a32624c94dd36e509baf3/t/67995f878b0b2b6c9b290038/1738104717089/4C_4Q24.pdf)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7ow29x92okke1.png?width=633&format=png&auto=webp&s=26bcc8aedaa65b0100d586dfea9b91a4bdcb543b\n\nNegative: DRO takes on very little debt, to little. Instead they have gradually over the years sold more shares. I would say this should slow down now cash is coming in through sales. \n\n  \nFurthermore they maintain a very healthy balance sheet with 220 million cash balance. Check out their website. Its a piece of art on its own: [https://www.droneshield.com/investor-relations](https://www.droneshield.com/investor-relations)\n\n  \nMy humble position:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ikyzvcrqfkke1.png?width=1534&format=png&auto=webp&s=565d7e0a27412ff805ca54df26f64635d2263423\n\nI plan to stay in for the long run. But if it moons again like last time I will take profit and step back in when the dust settled. \n\nThere is a lot more to be said about this company. But I leave that for the discussion. I hope I have been of service to my fellow regards at WSB.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. No AI was used making this DD. The first 3 graphs are not fully up to date with the latest earnings report.",

There is a slow down increase and with a nearest quantum chips release from IQVN, Google, Microsoft, I anticipate that this quarter can still have an increase but not impressive\n* So why I think Nvidia chips are stagnant?

They are supporting NASA‚Äôs Artemis program (for exploration, research, building infrastructures and digital lunar communications), and are notably partnered with Nokia to deploy the first cellular network on the Moon during the upcoming IM-2 mission.\n\nLet's now see what happened to their stock price during their first mission.\n\n* February 15, 2024: Intuitive Machines' first Moon mission, IM-1 (Nova-C lunar lander). Over the course of four days since launch date LUNR stock rose \\~150%.\n\nSecond Lunar Mission is scheduled to launch as soon as Feb 26th, and we may experience a new cycle of strong valorization, starting next week. Especially as we are now facing a one month correction since 24th January that brought the stock from peaks of $25 into current lows of $18, where we see strong support on the EMA 200 in the daily chart.\n\nTL;DR: Expect a strong rise in LUNR stock price next week in anticipation to the Second Lunar Mission launch scheduled to Feb 26th (they may move dates if any unexpected meteorological event happens).\n\nThe calls I bought yesterday during market crash:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c6538r0v1pke1.png?width=1401&format=png&auto=webp&s=be4eb450f7ed4438f1e5af2a2cd8cfaeffd7e96e\n\nOh I almost forgot.

          "title": "the sector you've never touched IS a 10-bagger, but not like that [DD w/ $250k invested)",
          "selftext": "A few days ago, I saw the[ \\[DD\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ir0k5o/this_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_dd/) posted here about the mining industry. The OP of this post was right to point out that the mining sector is due for a massive run and I appreciated the attention they drew to the qualities of a high return opportunity.¬† However, their recommendation was mostly to invest in mining related to GOLD! Reading that was like watching one set the dining table beautifully, only to proceed to mistake the appetizer for the main dish.\n\nToday I‚Äôm going to provide further evidence for the case that the mining industry presents a massive opportunity on a timescale anywhere from right now to the end of Trump‚Äôs term. The investments that are going to make you rich, however, have nothing to do with gold, per se, and everything to do with titanium, lithium, rare earth minerals, and the complete market dominance China has over their processing and extraction.\n\n**Part I: Ukraine, Greenland, Russia, Cosmetic Moguls, and the Allied Supply Chain**\n\nWhy does Trump care so much about Greenland? Why is he so insistent on Ukraine signing away 50% of their claim to Ukraine‚Äôs minerals and, if that matters so much, why did he cut Ukraine out from the opening negotiations with Russia?\n\nThe answer is that it's all about the supply chain of minerals and metals. China is bending us over the table with their grip over the chain (80-90%+ dominance), especially in separation/processing of the materials. Recently, they [have gone as far as to ban key processing/separation materials needed](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-lithium-company-halts-tech-exports-trade-tensions-build-2025-02-18/), posturing to protect their interests in the face of American policy strides to distance themselves from their grip over the market. They have also kept costs of lithium and other precious earth and minerals artificially low, stymieing western incentive to establish their own supply chain.\n\n[China has been *SO* effective at doing all of this,](https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/china-dominant-mineral-mining-global-supply-chain-e2b7840e) that until the last few years, there was **ZERO** mining/processing of rare earth happening domestically in the USA. The picture wasn‚Äôt much better for other crucial metals and resources, such as lithium and titanium. We slept too long, took them for granted, and now here we are.\n\nDon‚Äôt understand the stakes? [Here is **Marco Rubio**](https://uscriticalmaterials.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Marco-Rubio-video.mp4), our present secretary of state and who has recently opened up peace negotiations with Russia over Ukraine, being an absolute doomer about the state of play with the supply chain. **Lindsey Graham -** another key Trump ally - also has eyes on the issue, especially as it pertains to Ukraine and what they may offer us for security (check out these tweets [here ](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1891046931323040187)and [here](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1799832487285465244)).\n\nLet me be clear that this is a bipartisan issue and it is *extremely* difficult to deny the threat this poses to our national security and economic prosperity (the previous administration came to the same conclusion). That is why it has been a priority of both administrations. However, this present iteration of the Trump administration is uniquely situated to set the market ablaze in ways that previous administrations could not.\n\n**Part II. Convergence, Timing, Trump Administration, Private Equity, Executive Action**\n\nAlright, so we have established that the US is seriously threatened by China‚Äôs stranglehold over this sector. What is this administration doing and who are the relevant people involved? I don‚Äôt have time to give you all of the reasons that point me in favor of a bullish sentiment on titanium, lithium, and rare earth minerals. Here are a few that I take to be really supportive, however.\n\nFirst, let me introduce you to **Ronald S. Lauder**, heir to the Est√©e Lauder cosmetics company. For whatever reason, this guy has a real penchant for minerals and mining. He is [*close friends* with Donald Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/trump-ukraine-rare-earth-minerals.html) and is, according to the NY times, the one that initially led Trump to turn his attention to Greenland. He is also very interested in Ukrainian minerals and metals.\n\nYou see, Ronald Lauder is a business partner of **Brian Menell**, CEO of private investment/equity firm [**Techmet**](https://www.techmet.com/), which seeks to expand production of precious minerals across our global assets to help ensure a secure and sustainable supply of the key metals for western-aligned interests.\n\nIf there is one company to look at and one company alone, it is Techmet. Recently, they have secured 180 million from **QIA**. They are **DOE and DFC** contractors with extremely lucrative deals over the last few years. Furthermore, what makes them unusual is that the DFC decided against their usual financing terms and actually went ahead and bought a direct stake in Techmet itself. That means the **US Federal Government** is a stakeholder directly aligned with the interests and priorities of Techmet.¬†\n\nAs if this was not enough, Techmet also has the investment/backing of energy behemoth Mercuria. They also hold advisory members and business partners from big name mining companies like Rio Tinto. Furthermore, their current chairman is **Admiral Mike Mullen** who was previously Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, as well as on the board of **General Motors. S**uffice to say that their present reach and influence over western government is compelling as anything I have ever seen before.¬†\n\nIf you are curious, here is the CEO Brian Menell two or so weeks ago discussing the present state of the administration and supply chain issues [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP9_PY5gEug&ab_channel=SmarterMarkets%E2%84%A2) He is bullish about this administration and highlights what needs to happen in order to compete with China effectively.¬†\n\nWhat does he stress? **Permitting, Bureaucracy Reform, Federal Incentivization.** He calls on the administration to lift regulations, give permits quickly, purchase directly and invest in western-aligned companies that are working on the energy transition. Trump is doing *exactly* this, from establishing the sovereign wealth fund, to the guidance issued by way of two executive actions ‚Äú[Unleashing American Energy‚Äù](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/), as well as¬† [‚ÄúUnleashing Prosperity through Deregulation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-prosperity-through-deregulation/).‚Äù\n\nI recommend you read the language, especially Section 9 of the executive order on energy. The order seeks to ‚Äúestablish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states‚Äù as well as ‚Äúto protect the United States' economic and national security and military preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation‚Äù\n\nBy way of the executive orders, federal agencies are instructed (within 60 days) to identify and eliminate barriers to efficient private investment and reduce project timelines for critical energy. Trump also instructs that priority should be placed on making sure USA funds critical mineral ventures and he also instructs to make sure the USA has an adequate stockpile of critical minerals/metals (and to purchase more if not). Emphasis is also placed on geologic mapping, and key western partnerships that share national¬† security interests, called the **‚ÄúQuad.‚Äù** If you are interested in further reading on this last point, I recommend[ this article ](https://www.orfonline.org/research/the-case-for-a-quad-mineral-security-partnership#_edn81)on Quadrilateral Mineral Partnerships.\n\nHere is another item in the order on Unleashing American Energy:\n\n>(j) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy that includes policy recommendations to enhance the competitiveness of American mining and refining companies in other mineral-wealthy nations.\n\nTrump is not a patient man. He will act quickly after receiving this report in March and he is already trying his best to wrap up Ukraine as quickly as possible too with assurances of mineral access. That's why I believe the shortest timeline to return is now to the end of Trump's term.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that Trump's team began negotiations without Ukraine precisely because they are seeking to get the best minerals deal possible. Russian advances on Ukraine have meant that many of the precious minerals the west is interested in now falls within Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. Having 50% of the rights to Ukraine's rare earth is not all that great, given this reality**. There is no guarantee that Ukraine will win the war (or when), nor is there a guarantee they will ever regain the territory.** Meanwhile, the US would presumably continue to pump money into Ukraine with no end in sight? Trump isn't going to be OK with that. I think he is working out a post-war deal with Russia that makes certain that minerals will be available immediately.\n\n**Part III: Positions**\n\nWhere to invest? Well, Techmet is private. However, there are still plays that can be made in this sector. Right now I have \\~$250,000 in derivatives and stock opened yesterday and today. Here is where I am at the moment, though I will absolutely re-balance as I continue to do research.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oclseac8cjke1.jpg?width=665&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48232bf2a19ed448757da6cc248dee2453ae6faa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nznu3bc8cjke1.jpg?width=690&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=22a30e2408d70fb47c95264a4a8137c11402d7d1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/am8i3ac8cjke1.jpg?width=671&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ca74d99bd71812608bbe3a7bcbe1c4779e5c156\n\nWhy did I pick these? (don't mind Humana or Uber)\n\n>**MP materials** is presently the only rare earth mine and processor in the United States.\n\n>**LYS** is AU but part of \"The Quad\" that Trump opens the door for investments towards when he writes \"(k) The Secretary of State shall consider opportunities to advance the mining and processing of minerals within the United States through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.\"\n\n>**REEMF** is self-explanatory, rare earth exploration\n\n>**CAT**  is at a 6 month low. I thought that this was a good time to get in given ramping of mining in future. They have ties to Ukraine's post-war rebuilding via the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council (USUBC).\n\n>**TSLA** (not pictured; getting calls Monday) as Elon Musk is close with Trump and shares concern over lithium in particular. TSLA has [just launched operations in a lithium processing plant in TX as well](https://cen.acs.org/energy/energy-storage-/Tesla-begins-making-lithium-chemicals/102/web/2024/12#:~:text=Credit:%20Tesla,lithium%20production%20in%20the%20US) and I would not be surprised to see substantial federal funding in the short term and medium term. See [also this article.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/where-does-tesla-get-its-lithium)\n\n>**UUUU** is largely uranium although they are branching out. I'm bullish on it because of this language: \"(c) ¬†The Secretary of the Interior shall instruct the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey to consider updating the Survey‚Äôs list of critical minerals, including for the potential of including uranium.\"\n\n>**IPX** up-and-coming titanium processing w/ a special patent.\n\n>**Other ideas:** Talon Metals (nickel, partnered with TSLA);  ABAT, Holtec, anything having to do with Brazilian Nickel or General Atomics; anything related to the Quad countries and rare earth / metals. I would welcome other suggestions regarding investments that get the right kind of exposure.\n\nI'll close with this. Brian Menell, after meeting Mr. Zelensky in NY alongside other energy executives in September, had this to say in a statement:\n\n>‚ÄúTechMet, together with our partners, is available to move forward with further work if the U.S. and Ukrainian governments instruct us to do so\"\n\nWestern interests will be ready at a moments notice. Will you be?",

          "title": "the sector you've never touched IS a 10-bagger, but not like that [DD w/ $250k invested)",
          "selftext": "A few days ago, I saw the[ \\[DD\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ir0k5o/this_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_dd/) posted here about the mining industry. The OP of this post was right to point out that the mining sector is due for a massive run and I appreciated the attention they drew to the qualities of a high return opportunity.¬† However, their recommendation was mostly to invest in mining related to GOLD! Reading that was like watching one set the dining table beautifully, only to proceed to mistake the appetizer for the main dish.\n\nToday I‚Äôm going to provide further evidence for the case that the mining industry presents a massive opportunity on a timescale anywhere from right now to the end of Trump‚Äôs term. The investments that are going to make you rich, however, have nothing to do with gold, per se, and everything to do with titanium, lithium, rare earth minerals, and the complete market dominance China has over their processing and extraction.\n\n**Part I: Ukraine, Greenland, Russia, Cosmetic Moguls, and the Allied Supply Chain**\n\nWhy does Trump care so much about Greenland? Why is he so insistent on Ukraine signing away 50% of their claim to Ukraine‚Äôs minerals and, if that matters so much, why did he cut Ukraine out from the opening negotiations with Russia?\n\nThe answer is that it's all about the supply chain of minerals and metals. China is bending us over the table with their grip over the chain (80-90%+ dominance), especially in separation/processing of the materials. Recently, they [have gone as far as to ban key processing/separation materials needed](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-lithium-company-halts-tech-exports-trade-tensions-build-2025-02-18/), posturing to protect their interests in the face of American policy strides to distance themselves from their grip over the market. They have also kept costs of lithium and other precious earth and minerals artificially low, stymieing western incentive to establish their own supply chain.\n\n[China has been *SO* effective at doing all of this,](https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/china-dominant-mineral-mining-global-supply-chain-e2b7840e) that until the last few years, there was **ZERO** mining/processing of rare earth happening domestically in the USA. The picture wasn‚Äôt much better for other crucial metals and resources, such as lithium and titanium. We slept too long, took them for granted, and now here we are.\n\nDon‚Äôt understand the stakes? [Here is **Marco Rubio**](https://uscriticalmaterials.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Marco-Rubio-video.mp4), our present secretary of state and who has recently opened up peace negotiations with Russia over Ukraine, being an absolute doomer about the state of play with the supply chain. **Lindsey Graham -** another key Trump ally - also has eyes on the issue, especially as it pertains to Ukraine and what they may offer us for security (check out these tweets [here ](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1891046931323040187)and [here](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1799832487285465244)).\n\nLet me be clear that this is a bipartisan issue and it is *extremely* difficult to deny the threat this poses to our national security and economic prosperity (the previous administration came to the same conclusion). That is why it has been a priority of both administrations. However, this present iteration of the Trump administration is uniquely situated to set the market ablaze in ways that previous administrations could not.\n\n**Part II. Convergence, Timing, Trump Administration, Private Equity, Executive Action**\n\nAlright, so we have established that the US is seriously threatened by China‚Äôs stranglehold over this sector. What is this administration doing and who are the relevant people involved? I don‚Äôt have time to give you all of the reasons that point me in favor of a bullish sentiment on titanium, lithium, and rare earth minerals. Here are a few that I take to be really supportive, however.\n\nFirst, let me introduce you to **Ronald S. Lauder**, heir to the Est√©e Lauder cosmetics company. For whatever reason, this guy has a real penchant for minerals and mining. He is [*close friends* with Donald Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/trump-ukraine-rare-earth-minerals.html) and is, according to the NY times, the one that initially led Trump to turn his attention to Greenland. He is also very interested in Ukrainian minerals and metals.\n\nYou see, Ronald Lauder is a business partner of **Brian Menell**, CEO of private investment/equity firm [**Techmet**](https://www.techmet.com/), which seeks to expand production of precious minerals across our global assets to help ensure a secure and sustainable supply of the key metals for western-aligned interests.\n\nIf there is one company to look at and one company alone, it is Techmet. Recently, they have secured 180 million from **QIA**. They are **DOE and DFC** contractors with extremely lucrative deals over the last few years. Furthermore, what makes them unusual is that the DFC decided against their usual financing terms and actually went ahead and bought a direct stake in Techmet itself. That means the **US Federal Government** is a stakeholder directly aligned with the interests and priorities of Techmet.¬†\n\nAs if this was not enough, Techmet also has the investment/backing of energy behemoth Mercuria. They also hold advisory members and business partners from big name mining companies like Rio Tinto. Furthermore, their current chairman is **Admiral Mike Mullen** who was previously Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, as well as on the board of **General Motors. S**uffice to say that their present reach and influence over western government is compelling as anything I have ever seen before.¬†\n\nIf you are curious, here is the CEO Brian Menell two or so weeks ago discussing the present state of the administration and supply chain issues [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP9_PY5gEug&ab_channel=SmarterMarkets%E2%84%A2) He is bullish about this administration and highlights what needs to happen in order to compete with China effectively.¬†\n\nWhat does he stress? **Permitting, Bureaucracy Reform, Federal Incentivization.** He calls on the administration to lift regulations, give permits quickly, purchase directly and invest in western-aligned companies that are working on the energy transition. Trump is doing *exactly* this, from establishing the sovereign wealth fund, to the guidance issued by way of two executive actions ‚Äú[Unleashing American Energy‚Äù](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/), as well as¬† [‚ÄúUnleashing Prosperity through Deregulation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-prosperity-through-deregulation/).‚Äù\n\nI recommend you read the language, especially Section 9 of the executive order on energy. The order seeks to ‚Äúestablish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states‚Äù as well as ‚Äúto protect the United States' economic and national security and military preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation‚Äù\n\nBy way of the executive orders, federal agencies are instructed (within 60 days) to identify and eliminate barriers to efficient private investment and reduce project timelines for critical energy. Trump also instructs that priority should be placed on making sure USA funds critical mineral ventures and he also instructs to make sure the USA has an adequate stockpile of critical minerals/metals (and to purchase more if not). Emphasis is also placed on geologic mapping, and key western partnerships that share national¬† security interests, called the **‚ÄúQuad.‚Äù** If you are interested in further reading on this last point, I recommend[ this article ](https://www.orfonline.org/research/the-case-for-a-quad-mineral-security-partnership#_edn81)on Quadrilateral Mineral Partnerships.\n\nHere is another item in the order on Unleashing American Energy:\n\n>(j) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy that includes policy recommendations to enhance the competitiveness of American mining and refining companies in other mineral-wealthy nations.\n\nTrump is not a patient man. He will act quickly after receiving this report in March and he is already trying his best to wrap up Ukraine as quickly as possible too with assurances of mineral access. That's why I believe the shortest timeline to return is now to the end of Trump's term.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that Trump's team began negotiations without Ukraine precisely because they are seeking to get the best minerals deal possible. Russian advances on Ukraine have meant that many of the precious minerals the west is interested in now falls within Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. Having 50% of the rights to Ukraine's rare earth is not all that great, given this reality**. There is no guarantee that Ukraine will win the war (or when), nor is there a guarantee they will ever regain the territory.** Meanwhile, the US would presumably continue to pump money into Ukraine with no end in sight? Trump isn't going to be OK with that. I think he is working out a post-war deal with Russia that makes certain that minerals will be available immediately.\n\n**Part III: Positions**\n\nWhere to invest? Well, Techmet is private. However, there are still plays that can be made in this sector. Right now I have \\~$250,000 in derivatives and stock opened yesterday and today. Here is where I am at the moment, though I will absolutely re-balance as I continue to do research.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oclseac8cjke1.jpg?width=665&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48232bf2a19ed448757da6cc248dee2453ae6faa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nznu3bc8cjke1.jpg?width=690&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=22a30e2408d70fb47c95264a4a8137c11402d7d1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/am8i3ac8cjke1.jpg?width=671&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ca74d99bd71812608bbe3a7bcbe1c4779e5c156\n\nWhy did I pick these? (don't mind Humana or Uber)\n\n>**MP materials** is presently the only rare earth mine and processor in the United States.\n\n>**LYS** is AU but part of \"The Quad\" that Trump opens the door for investments towards when he writes \"(k) The Secretary of State shall consider opportunities to advance the mining and processing of minerals within the United States through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.\"\n\n>**REEMF** is self-explanatory, rare earth exploration\n\n>**CAT**  is at a 6 month low. I thought that this was a good time to get in given ramping of mining in future. They have ties to Ukraine's post-war rebuilding via the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council (USUBC).\n\n>**TSLA** (not pictured; getting calls Monday) as Elon Musk is close with Trump and shares concern over lithium in particular. TSLA has [just launched operations in a lithium processing plant in TX as well](https://cen.acs.org/energy/energy-storage-/Tesla-begins-making-lithium-chemicals/102/web/2024/12#:~:text=Credit:%20Tesla,lithium%20production%20in%20the%20US) and I would not be surprised to see substantial federal funding in the short term and medium term. See [also this article.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/where-does-tesla-get-its-lithium)\n\n>**UUUU** is largely uranium although they are branching out. I'm bullish on it because of this language: \"(c) ¬†The Secretary of the Interior shall instruct the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey to consider updating the Survey‚Äôs list of critical minerals, including for the potential of including uranium.\"\n\n>**IPX** up-and-coming titanium processing w/ a special patent.\n\n>**Other ideas:** Talon Metals (nickel, partnered with TSLA);  ABAT, Holtec, anything having to do with Brazilian Nickel or General Atomics; anything related to the Quad countries and rare earth / metals. I would welcome other suggestions regarding investments that get the right kind of exposure.\n\nI'll close with this. Brian Menell, after meeting Mr. Zelensky in NY alongside other energy executives in September, had this to say in a statement:\n\n>‚ÄúTechMet, together with our partners, is available to move forward with further work if the U.S. and Ukrainian governments instruct us to do so\"\n\nWestern interests will be ready at a moments notice. Will you be?",

          "selftext": "TLDR: Rivian is a BUY, because it‚Äôs cheap  \n\nPost earnings call, Rivian has found gross profit, reducing vehicle production costs by $30k.  \n\nEyeing the R2 release in a year, they‚Äôve sourced 95% of materials for it at half the cost of R1, seeing growing bargaining power in negotiations while realizing opportunities for production efficiencies.\n\nPeople are pumped about the R2 release.  \n\nWith $7B of cash they are guiding towards a <($2B) loss for 2025 -  \n\nleaving $5B of cash + $3.4B more from VW deal, putting them at a future $8.4B in cash alone for capex and expansion.  \n\nWhile the DOE loan might see pressure, they will also create **7500 US MANUFACTURING JOBS in Georgia**.  \n\nKilling manufacturing jobs isn‚Äôt really aligned with the current admin goals, even as they talk about ICE vehicles and the need to drill more.  \n\nGuidance for ‚Äò25 was conservatively flat given the environment, however -  \n\nWith Tesla protests happening and a deep fleet of existing owners, the Tesla to Rivian trade-up is happening in force, which will especially add to R2 demand and existing R1 demand.  \n\nBetween R2 revenue at minimum $4.5B in ‚Äò26, R1 sales, VW JV bringing in $2B in revenue (or more, as VW CEO has hinted at), potential further demand from other makers for Rivian tech,  \n\nAll of which doesn‚Äôt include EDV sales which just opened in February to other fleets, while they guide lower due to Amazon taking on slightly more orders in '24 and slightly less in '25, this is a unique differentiator that furthers the upside.\n\nRivian not only has a strong path to profitability, but likely future SPY inclusion as it reaches scale and profitability.  \n\nRivian is well capitalized, backed by big players who believe in their position, and most importantly -  \n\nPEOPLE LOVE THEIR PRODUCT.  \n\nIn the last year, Rivian is down 15%, while the company position and story becomes better and better.  \n\nLove the trade and upside here!\n\n(Positions: Long calls and shares)",

Even if Tesla loses all of 300k sales in Europe and 60k sales per year in Canada.  He expect to more than make up for it those countries.   So yes people in Western nations can try to boycott his products even in the US, but he is expanding into markets where Western culture is less celebrated.

There is a slow down increase and with a nearest quantum chips release from IQVN, Google, Microsoft, I anticipate that this quarter can still have an increase but not impressive\n* So why I think Nvidia chips are stagnant? The investment of research from their previous earnings clearly shows that they don't want to heavily invest in research as much as before --> Chips independent era gonna be coming.\n\nWhy you should buy calls?\n\n* Because I buy puts\n\nPosition:\n\n[Position](https://preview.redd.it/5yp493fq8jke1.png?width=1372&format=png&auto=webp&s=042b36e8d27ba302fbd34fa70c73ee90ef1e3462)\n\nI buy on August because there are around 150k investment in the same investment and hey I am regarded.   \n  \nI eat crayon to make this dd so NFA but hey I'm gey bear.   \n  \n",

          "selftext": "Hello Regards,\n\nDroneshield (DRO) is showing promising returns and WSB seems unaware. A quick search on google trends would make it seem that the USA are not aware of the stock at the moment. So here is a small DD to get this beauty of a company on your radar and not leave all the tendies to the Germans and Australians. \n\n  \nPlain and simple:\n\nDRO develops and sells anti-drone tech. DRO engineers, produces and maintains their own products. \n\nCostumers: EU countries that are ramping up their drone defense systems since Ukraine has demonstrated the dangers of drones. Countries neighboring China since they also can't keep their drones to themselves. South American countries that are trying to counter the use of drones by the drug cartels.\n\nAdded value: Their products protect and save lives.\n\n[Their revenue is ramping up with repeat orders by satisfied customers.](https://preview.redd.it/zp0bc0imhkke1.png?width=1058&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc4cd9e2d400ab64f4fdeee2bcf84c4b8293e514)\n\n.\n\n[They manage to maintain super healthy gross profit margins.](https://preview.redd.it/oy2dheyyhkke1.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfcdc462de4e6c547a8c3325948efb6256ba61bd)\n\n.\n\n[Net profit margin transitioned into the green. ](https://preview.redd.it/hrvdph1qikke1.png?width=1057&format=png&auto=webp&s=596bfe90e67ba299511afd52132c499501c31797)\n\nWhy is the net profit margin relatively low: 200 of their 255 employees are engineers that R&D this company to perfection. My guess is that this is quite expensive. Droneshield understands: great value comes from great products. And great products bring in great costumers.\n\n  \nHere is a page out of their latest earnings report. This update caused the reverse of the trend. It shows that their revenue spike was not a one off event but only the beginning of the profitable era. Read the full report here: [https://static1.squarespace.com/static/660a32624c94dd36e509baf3/t/67995f878b0b2b6c9b290038/1738104717089/4C\\_4Q24.pdf](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/660a32624c94dd36e509baf3/t/67995f878b0b2b6c9b290038/1738104717089/4C_4Q24.pdf)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7ow29x92okke1.png?width=633&format=png&auto=webp&s=26bcc8aedaa65b0100d586dfea9b91a4bdcb543b\n\nNegative: DRO takes on very little debt, to little. Instead they have gradually over the years sold more shares. I would say this should slow down now cash is coming in through sales. \n\n  \nFurthermore they maintain a very healthy balance sheet with 220 million cash balance. Check out their website. Its a piece of art on its own: [https://www.droneshield.com/investor-relations](https://www.droneshield.com/investor-relations)\n\n  \nMy humble position:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ikyzvcrqfkke1.png?width=1534&format=png&auto=webp&s=565d7e0a27412ff805ca54df26f64635d2263423\n\nI plan to stay in for the long run. But if it moons again like last time I will take profit and step back in when the dust settled. \n\nThere is a lot more to be said about this company. But I leave that for the discussion. I hope I have been of service to my fellow regards at WSB.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. No AI was used making this DD.

          "selftext": "A few days ago, I saw the[ \\[DD\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ir0k5o/this_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_dd/) posted here about the mining industry. The OP of this post was right to point out that the mining sector is due for a massive run and I appreciated the attention they drew to the qualities of a high return opportunity.¬† However, their recommendation was mostly to invest in mining related to GOLD! Reading that was like watching one set the dining table beautifully, only to proceed to mistake the appetizer for the main dish.\n\nToday I‚Äôm going to provide further evidence for the case that the mining industry presents a massive opportunity on a timescale anywhere from right now to the end of Trump‚Äôs term. The investments that are going to make you rich, however, have nothing to do with gold, per se, and everything to do with titanium, lithium, rare earth minerals, and the complete market dominance China has over their processing and extraction.\n\n**Part I: Ukraine, Greenland, Russia, Cosmetic Moguls, and the Allied Supply Chain**\n\nWhy does Trump care so much about Greenland? Why is he so insistent on Ukraine signing away 50% of their claim to Ukraine‚Äôs minerals and, if that matters so much, why did he cut Ukraine out from the opening negotiations with Russia?\n\nThe answer is that it's all about the supply chain of minerals and metals. China is bending us over the table with their grip over the chain (80-90%+ dominance), especially in separation/processing of the materials. Recently, they [have gone as far as to ban key processing/separation materials needed](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-lithium-company-halts-tech-exports-trade-tensions-build-2025-02-18/), posturing to protect their interests in the face of American policy strides to distance themselves from their grip over the market. They have also kept costs of lithium and other precious earth and minerals artificially low, stymieing western incentive to establish their own supply chain.\n\n[China has been *SO* effective at doing all of this,](https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/china-dominant-mineral-mining-global-supply-chain-e2b7840e) that until the last few years, there was **ZERO** mining/processing of rare earth happening domestically in the USA. The picture wasn‚Äôt much better for other crucial metals and resources, such as lithium and titanium. We slept too long, took them for granted, and now here we are.\n\nDon‚Äôt understand the stakes? [Here is **Marco Rubio**](https://uscriticalmaterials.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Marco-Rubio-video.mp4), our present secretary of state and who has recently opened up peace negotiations with Russia over Ukraine, being an absolute doomer about the state of play with the supply chain. **Lindsey Graham -** another key Trump ally - also has eyes on the issue, especially as it pertains to Ukraine and what they may offer us for security (check out these tweets [here ](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1891046931323040187)and [here](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1799832487285465244)).\n\nLet me be clear that this is a bipartisan issue and it is *extremely* difficult to deny the threat this poses to our national security and economic prosperity (the previous administration came to the same conclusion). That is why it has been a priority of both administrations. However, this present iteration of the Trump administration is uniquely situated to set the market ablaze in ways that previous administrations could not.\n\n**Part II. Convergence, Timing, Trump Administration, Private Equity, Executive Action**\n\nAlright, so we have established that the US is seriously threatened by China‚Äôs stranglehold over this sector. What is this administration doing and who are the relevant people involved? I don‚Äôt have time to give you all of the reasons that point me in favor of a bullish sentiment on titanium, lithium, and rare earth minerals. Here are a few that I take to be really supportive, however.\n\nFirst, let me introduce you to **Ronald S. Lauder**, heir to the Est√©e Lauder cosmetics company. For whatever reason, this guy has a real penchant for minerals and mining. He is [*close friends* with Donald Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/trump-ukraine-rare-earth-minerals.html) and is, according to the NY times, the one that initially led Trump to turn his attention to Greenland. He is also very interested in Ukrainian minerals and metals.\n\nYou see, Ronald Lauder is a business partner of **Brian Menell**, CEO of private investment/equity firm [**Techmet**](https://www.techmet.com/), which seeks to expand production of precious minerals across our global assets to help ensure a secure and sustainable supply of the key metals for western-aligned interests.\n\nIf there is one company to look at and one company alone, it is Techmet. Recently, they have secured 180 million from **QIA**. They are **DOE and DFC** contractors with extremely lucrative deals over the last few years. Furthermore, what makes them unusual is that the DFC decided against their usual financing terms and actually went ahead and bought a direct stake in Techmet itself. That means the **US Federal Government** is a stakeholder directly aligned with the interests and priorities of Techmet.¬†\n\nAs if this was not enough, Techmet also has the investment/backing of energy behemoth Mercuria. They also hold advisory members and business partners from big name mining companies like Rio Tinto. Furthermore, their current chairman is **Admiral Mike Mullen** who was previously Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, as well as on the board of **General Motors. S**uffice to say that their present reach and influence over western government is compelling as anything I have ever seen before.¬†\n\nIf you are curious, here is the CEO Brian Menell two or so weeks ago discussing the present state of the administration and supply chain issues [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP9_PY5gEug&ab_channel=SmarterMarkets%E2%84%A2) He is bullish about this administration and highlights what needs to happen in order to compete with China effectively.¬†\n\nWhat does he stress? **Permitting, Bureaucracy Reform, Federal Incentivization.** He calls on the administration to lift regulations, give permits quickly, purchase directly and invest in western-aligned companies that are working on the energy transition. Trump is doing *exactly* this, from establishing the sovereign wealth fund, to the guidance issued by way of two executive actions ‚Äú[Unleashing American Energy‚Äù](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/), as well as¬† [‚ÄúUnleashing Prosperity through Deregulation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-prosperity-through-deregulation/).‚Äù\n\nI recommend you read the language, especially Section 9 of the executive order on energy. The order seeks to ‚Äúestablish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states‚Äù as well as ‚Äúto protect the United States' economic and national security and military preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation‚Äù\n\nBy way of the executive orders, federal agencies are instructed (within 60 days) to identify and eliminate barriers to efficient private investment and reduce project timelines for critical energy. Trump also instructs that priority should be placed on making sure USA funds critical mineral ventures and he also instructs to make sure the USA has an adequate stockpile of critical minerals/metals (and to purchase more if not). Emphasis is also placed on geologic mapping, and key western partnerships that share national¬† security interests, called the **‚ÄúQuad.‚Äù** If you are interested in further reading on this last point, I recommend[ this article ](https://www.orfonline.org/research/the-case-for-a-quad-mineral-security-partnership#_edn81)on Quadrilateral Mineral Partnerships.\n\nHere is another item in the order on Unleashing American Energy:\n\n>(j) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy that includes policy recommendations to enhance the competitiveness of American mining and refining companies in other mineral-wealthy nations.\n\nTrump is not a patient man. He will act quickly after receiving this report in March and he is already trying his best to wrap up Ukraine as quickly as possible too with assurances of mineral access. That's why I believe the shortest timeline to return is now to the end of Trump's term.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that Trump's team began negotiations without Ukraine precisely because they are seeking to get the best minerals deal possible. Russian advances on Ukraine have meant that many of the precious minerals the west is interested in now falls within Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. Having 50% of the rights to Ukraine's rare earth is not all that great, given this reality**. There is no guarantee that Ukraine will win the war (or when), nor is there a guarantee they will ever regain the territory.** Meanwhile, the US would presumably continue to pump money into Ukraine with no end in sight? Trump isn't going to be OK with that. I think he is working out a post-war deal with Russia that makes certain that minerals will be available immediately.\n\n**Part III: Positions**\n\nWhere to invest? Well, Techmet is private. However, there are still plays that can be made in this sector. Right now I have \\~$250,000 in derivatives and stock opened yesterday and today. Here is where I am at the moment, though I will absolutely re-balance as I continue to do research.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oclseac8cjke1.jpg?width=665&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48232bf2a19ed448757da6cc248dee2453ae6faa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nznu3bc8cjke1.jpg?width=690&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=22a30e2408d70fb47c95264a4a8137c11402d7d1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/am8i3ac8cjke1.jpg?width=671&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ca74d99bd71812608bbe3a7bcbe1c4779e5c156\n\nWhy did I pick these? (don't mind Humana or Uber)\n\n>**MP materials** is presently the only rare earth mine and processor in the United States.\n\n>**LYS** is AU but part of \"The Quad\" that Trump opens the door for investments towards when he writes \"(k) The Secretary of State shall consider opportunities to advance the mining and processing of minerals within the United States through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.\"\n\n>**REEMF** is self-explanatory, rare earth exploration\n\n>**CAT**  is at a 6 month low. I thought that this was a good time to get in given ramping of mining in future. They have ties to Ukraine's post-war rebuilding via the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council (USUBC).\n\n>**TSLA** (not pictured; getting calls Monday) as Elon Musk is close with Trump and shares concern over lithium in particular. TSLA has [just launched operations in a lithium processing plant in TX as well](https://cen.acs.org/energy/energy-storage-/Tesla-begins-making-lithium-chemicals/102/web/2024/12#:~:text=Credit:%20Tesla,lithium%20production%20in%20the%20US) and I would not be surprised to see substantial federal funding in the short term and medium term. See [also this article.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/where-does-tesla-get-its-lithium)\n\n>**UUUU** is largely uranium although they are branching out. I'm bullish on it because of this language: \"(c) ¬†The Secretary of the Interior shall instruct the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey to consider updating the Survey‚Äôs list of critical minerals, including for the potential of including uranium.\"\n\n>**IPX** up-and-coming titanium processing w/ a special patent.\n\n>**Other ideas:** Talon Metals (nickel, partnered with TSLA);  ABAT, Holtec, anything having to do with Brazilian Nickel or General Atomics; anything related to the Quad countries and rare earth / metals. I would welcome other suggestions regarding investments that get the right kind of exposure.\n\nI'll close with this. Brian Menell, after meeting Mr. Zelensky in NY alongside other energy executives in September, had this to say in a statement:\n\n>‚ÄúTechMet, together with our partners, is available to move forward with further work if the U.S. and Ukrainian governments instruct us to do so\"\n\nWestern interests will be ready at a moments notice. Will you be?",

          "title": "the sector you've never touched IS a 10-bagger, but not like that [DD w/ $250k invested)",
          "selftext": "A few days ago, I saw the[ \\[DD\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ir0k5o/this_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_dd/) posted here about the mining industry. The OP of this post was right to point out that the mining sector is due for a massive run and I appreciated the attention they drew to the qualities of a high return opportunity.¬† However, their recommendation was mostly to invest in mining related to GOLD! Reading that was like watching one set the dining table beautifully, only to proceed to mistake the appetizer for the main dish.\n\nToday I‚Äôm going to provide further evidence for the case that the mining industry presents a massive opportunity on a timescale anywhere from right now to the end of Trump‚Äôs term. The investments that are going to make you rich, however, have nothing to do with gold, per se, and everything to do with titanium, lithium, rare earth minerals, and the complete market dominance China has over their processing and extraction.\n\n**Part I: Ukraine, Greenland, Russia, Cosmetic Moguls, and the Allied Supply Chain**\n\nWhy does Trump care so much about Greenland? Why is he so insistent on Ukraine signing away 50% of their claim to Ukraine‚Äôs minerals and, if that matters so much, why did he cut Ukraine out from the opening negotiations with Russia?\n\nThe answer is that it's all about the supply chain of minerals and metals. China is bending us over the table with their grip over the chain (80-90%+ dominance), especially in separation/processing of the materials. Recently, they [have gone as far as to ban key processing/separation materials needed](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-lithium-company-halts-tech-exports-trade-tensions-build-2025-02-18/), posturing to protect their interests in the face of American policy strides to distance themselves from their grip over the market. They have also kept costs of lithium and other precious earth and minerals artificially low, stymieing western incentive to establish their own supply chain.\n\n[China has been *SO* effective at doing all of this,](https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/china-dominant-mineral-mining-global-supply-chain-e2b7840e) that until the last few years, there was **ZERO** mining/processing of rare earth happening domestically in the USA. The picture wasn‚Äôt much better for other crucial metals and resources, such as lithium and titanium. We slept too long, took them for granted, and now here we are.\n\nDon‚Äôt understand the stakes? [Here is **Marco Rubio**](https://uscriticalmaterials.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Marco-Rubio-video.mp4), our present secretary of state and who has recently opened up peace negotiations with Russia over Ukraine, being an absolute doomer about the state of play with the supply chain. **Lindsey Graham -** another key Trump ally - also has eyes on the issue, especially as it pertains to Ukraine and what they may offer us for security (check out these tweets [here ](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1891046931323040187)and [here](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1799832487285465244)).\n\nLet me be clear that this is a bipartisan issue and it is *extremely* difficult to deny the threat this poses to our national security and economic prosperity (the previous administration came to the same conclusion). That is why it has been a priority of both administrations. However, this present iteration of the Trump administration is uniquely situated to set the market ablaze in ways that previous administrations could not.\n\n**Part II. Convergence, Timing, Trump Administration, Private Equity, Executive Action**\n\nAlright, so we have established that the US is seriously threatened by China‚Äôs stranglehold over this sector. What is this administration doing and who are the relevant people involved? I don‚Äôt have time to give you all of the reasons that point me in favor of a bullish sentiment on titanium, lithium, and rare earth minerals. Here are a few that I take to be really supportive, however.\n\nFirst, let me introduce you to **Ronald S. Lauder**, heir to the Est√©e Lauder cosmetics company. For whatever reason, this guy has a real penchant for minerals and mining. He is [*close friends* with Donald Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/trump-ukraine-rare-earth-minerals.html) and is, according to the NY times, the one that initially led Trump to turn his attention to Greenland. He is also very interested in Ukrainian minerals and metals.\n\nYou see, Ronald Lauder is a business partner of **Brian Menell**, CEO of private investment/equity firm [**Techmet**](https://www.techmet.com/), which seeks to expand production of precious minerals across our global assets to help ensure a secure and sustainable supply of the key metals for western-aligned interests.\n\nIf there is one company to look at and one company alone, it is Techmet. Recently, they have secured 180 million from **QIA**. They are **DOE and DFC** contractors with extremely lucrative deals over the last few years. Furthermore, what makes them unusual is that the DFC decided against their usual financing terms and actually went ahead and bought a direct stake in Techmet itself. That means the **US Federal Government** is a stakeholder directly aligned with the interests and priorities of Techmet.¬†\n\nAs if this was not enough, Techmet also has the investment/backing of energy behemoth Mercuria. They also hold advisory members and business partners from big name mining companies like Rio Tinto. Furthermore, their current chairman is **Admiral Mike Mullen** who was previously Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, as well as on the board of **General Motors. S**uffice to say that their present reach and influence over western government is compelling as anything I have ever seen before.¬†\n\nIf you are curious, here is the CEO Brian Menell two or so weeks ago discussing the present state of the administration and supply chain issues [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP9_PY5gEug&ab_channel=SmarterMarkets%E2%84%A2) He is bullish about this administration and highlights what needs to happen in order to compete with China effectively.¬†\n\nWhat does he stress? **Permitting, Bureaucracy Reform, Federal Incentivization.** He calls on the administration to lift regulations, give permits quickly, purchase directly and invest in western-aligned companies that are working on the energy transition. Trump is doing *exactly* this, from establishing the sovereign wealth fund, to the guidance issued by way of two executive actions ‚Äú[Unleashing American Energy‚Äù](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/), as well as¬† [‚ÄúUnleashing Prosperity through Deregulation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-prosperity-through-deregulation/).‚Äù\n\nI recommend you read the language, especially Section 9 of the executive order on energy. The order seeks to ‚Äúestablish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states‚Äù as well as ‚Äúto protect the United States' economic and national security and military preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation‚Äù\n\nBy way of the executive orders, federal agencies are instructed (within 60 days) to identify and eliminate barriers to efficient private investment and reduce project timelines for critical energy. Trump also instructs that priority should be placed on making sure USA funds critical mineral ventures and he also instructs to make sure the USA has an adequate stockpile of critical minerals/metals (and to purchase more if not). Emphasis is also placed on geologic mapping, and key western partnerships that share national¬† security interests, called the **‚ÄúQuad.‚Äù** If you are interested in further reading on this last point, I recommend[ this article ](https://www.orfonline.org/research/the-case-for-a-quad-mineral-security-partnership#_edn81)on Quadrilateral Mineral Partnerships.\n\nHere is another item in the order on Unleashing American Energy:\n\n>(j) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy that includes policy recommendations to enhance the competitiveness of American mining and refining companies in other mineral-wealthy nations.\n\nTrump is not a patient man. He will act quickly after receiving this report in March and he is already trying his best to wrap up Ukraine as quickly as possible too with assurances of mineral access. That's why I believe the shortest timeline to return is now to the end of Trump's term.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that Trump's team began negotiations without Ukraine precisely because they are seeking to get the best minerals deal possible. Russian advances on Ukraine have meant that many of the precious minerals the west is interested in now falls within Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. Having 50% of the rights to Ukraine's rare earth is not all that great, given this reality**. There is no guarantee that Ukraine will win the war (or when), nor is there a guarantee they will ever regain the territory.** Meanwhile, the US would presumably continue to pump money into Ukraine with no end in sight? Trump isn't going to be OK with that. I think he is working out a post-war deal with Russia that makes certain that minerals will be available immediately.\n\n**Part III: Positions**\n\nWhere to invest? Well, Techmet is private. However, there are still plays that can be made in this sector. Right now I have \\~$250,000 in derivatives and stock opened yesterday and today. Here is where I am at the moment, though I will absolutely re-balance as I continue to do research.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oclseac8cjke1.jpg?width=665&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48232bf2a19ed448757da6cc248dee2453ae6faa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nznu3bc8cjke1.jpg?width=690&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=22a30e2408d70fb47c95264a4a8137c11402d7d1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/am8i3ac8cjke1.jpg?width=671&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ca74d99bd71812608bbe3a7bcbe1c4779e5c156\n\nWhy did I pick these? (don't mind Humana or Uber)\n\n>**MP materials** is presently the only rare earth mine and processor in the United States.\n\n>**LYS** is AU but part of \"The Quad\" that Trump opens the door for investments towards when he writes \"(k) The Secretary of State shall consider opportunities to advance the mining and processing of minerals within the United States through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.\"\n\n>**REEMF** is self-explanatory, rare earth exploration\n\n>**CAT**  is at a 6 month low. I thought that this was a good time to get in given ramping of mining in future. They have ties to Ukraine's post-war rebuilding via the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council (USUBC).\n\n>**TSLA** (not pictured; getting calls Monday) as Elon Musk is close with Trump and shares concern over lithium in particular. TSLA has [just launched operations in a lithium processing plant in TX as well](https://cen.acs.org/energy/energy-storage-/Tesla-begins-making-lithium-chemicals/102/web/2024/12#:~:text=Credit:%20Tesla,lithium%20production%20in%20the%20US) and I would not be surprised to see substantial federal funding in the short term and medium term. See [also this article.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/where-does-tesla-get-its-lithium)\n\n>**UUUU** is largely uranium although they are branching out. I'm bullish on it because of this language: \"(c) ¬†The Secretary of the Interior shall instruct the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey to consider updating the Survey‚Äôs list of critical minerals, including for the potential of including uranium.\"\n\n>**IPX** up-and-coming titanium processing w/ a special patent.\n\n>**Other ideas:** Talon Metals (nickel, partnered with TSLA);  ABAT, Holtec, anything having to do with Brazilian Nickel or General Atomics; anything related to the Quad countries and rare earth / metals. I would welcome other suggestions regarding investments that get the right kind of exposure.\n\nI'll close with this. Brian Menell, after meeting Mr. Zelensky in NY alongside other energy executives in September, had this to say in a statement:\n\n>‚ÄúTechMet, together with our partners, is available to move forward with further work if the U.S. and Ukrainian governments instruct us to do so\"\n\nWestern interests will be ready at a moments notice. Will you be?",

There is a slow down increase and with a nearest quantum chips release from IQVN, Google, Microsoft, I anticipate that this quarter can still have an increase but not impressive\n* So why I think Nvidia chips are stagnant? The investment of research from their previous earnings clearly shows that they don't want to heavily invest in research as much as before --> Chips independent era gonna be coming.\n\nWhy you should buy calls?\n\n* Because I buy puts\n\nPosition:\n\n[Position](https://preview.redd.it/5yp493fq8jke1.png?width=1372&format=png&auto=webp&s=042b36e8d27ba302fbd34fa70c73ee90ef1e3462)\n\nI buy on August because there are around 150k investment in the same investment and hey I am regarded.   \n  \nI eat crayon to make this dd so NFA but hey I'm gey bear.   \n  \n",

          "selftext": "TLDR: Rivian is a BUY, because it‚Äôs cheap  \n\nPost earnings call, Rivian has found gross profit, reducing vehicle production costs by $30k.  \n\nEyeing the R2 release in a year, they‚Äôve sourced 95% of materials for it at half the cost of R1, seeing growing bargaining power in negotiations while realizing opportunities for production efficiencies.\n\nPeople are pumped about the R2 release.  \n\nWith $7B of cash they are guiding towards a <($2B) loss for 2025 -  \n\nleaving $5B of cash + $3.4B more from VW deal, putting them at a future $8.4B in cash alone for capex and expansion.  \n\nWhile the DOE loan might see pressure, they will also create **7500 US MANUFACTURING JOBS in Georgia**.  \n\nKilling manufacturing jobs isn‚Äôt really aligned with the current admin goals, even as they talk about ICE vehicles and the need to drill more.  \n\nGuidance for ‚Äò25 was conservatively flat given the environment, however -  \n\nWith Tesla protests happening and a deep fleet of existing owners, the Tesla to Rivian trade-up is happening in force, which will especially add to R2 demand and existing R1 demand.  \n\nBetween R2 revenue at minimum $4.5B in ‚Äò26, R1 sales, VW JV bringing in $2B in revenue (or more, as VW CEO has hinted at), potential further demand from other makers for Rivian tech,  \n\nAll of which doesn‚Äôt include EDV sales which just opened in February to other fleets, while they guide lower due to Amazon taking on slightly more orders in '24 and slightly less in '25, this is a unique differentiator that furthers the upside.\n\nRivian not only has a strong path to profitability, but likely future SPY inclusion as it reaches scale and profitability.  \n\nRivian is well capitalized, backed by big players who believe in their position, and most importantly -  \n\nPEOPLE LOVE THEIR PRODUCT.  \n\nIn the last year, Rivian is down 15%, while the company position and story becomes better and better.  \n\nLove the trade and upside here!\n\n(Positions: Long calls and shares)",

          "selftext": "A few days ago, I saw the[ \\[DD\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ir0k5o/this_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_dd/) posted here about the mining industry. The OP of this post was right to point out that the mining sector is due for a massive run and I appreciated the attention they drew to the qualities of a high return opportunity.¬† However, their recommendation was mostly to invest in mining related to GOLD! Reading that was like watching one set the dining table beautifully, only to proceed to mistake the appetizer for the main dish.\n\nToday I‚Äôm going to provide further evidence for the case that the mining industry presents a massive opportunity on a timescale anywhere from right now to the end of Trump‚Äôs term. The investments that are going to make you rich, however, have nothing to do with gold, per se, and everything to do with titanium, lithium, rare earth minerals, and the complete market dominance China has over their processing and extraction.\n\n**Part I: Ukraine, Greenland, Russia, Cosmetic Moguls, and the Allied Supply Chain**\n\nWhy does Trump care so much about Greenland? Why is he so insistent on Ukraine signing away 50% of their claim to Ukraine‚Äôs minerals and, if that matters so much, why did he cut Ukraine out from the opening negotiations with Russia?\n\nThe answer is that it's all about the supply chain of minerals and metals. China is bending us over the table with their grip over the chain (80-90%+ dominance), especially in separation/processing of the materials. Recently, they [have gone as far as to ban key processing/separation materials needed](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-lithium-company-halts-tech-exports-trade-tensions-build-2025-02-18/), posturing to protect their interests in the face of American policy strides to distance themselves from their grip over the market. They have also kept costs of lithium and other precious earth and minerals artificially low, stymieing western incentive to establish their own supply chain.\n\n[China has been *SO* effective at doing all of this,](https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/china-dominant-mineral-mining-global-supply-chain-e2b7840e) that until the last few years, there was **ZERO** mining/processing of rare earth happening domestically in the USA. The picture wasn‚Äôt much better for other crucial metals and resources, such as lithium and titanium. We slept too long, took them for granted, and now here we are.\n\nDon‚Äôt understand the stakes? [Here is **Marco Rubio**](https://uscriticalmaterials.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Marco-Rubio-video.mp4), our present secretary of state and who has recently opened up peace negotiations with Russia over Ukraine, being an absolute doomer about the state of play with the supply chain. **Lindsey Graham -** another key Trump ally - also has eyes on the issue, especially as it pertains to Ukraine and what they may offer us for security (check out these tweets [here ](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1891046931323040187)and [here](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1799832487285465244)).\n\nLet me be clear that this is a bipartisan issue and it is *extremely* difficult to deny the threat this poses to our national security and economic prosperity (the previous administration came to the same conclusion). That is why it has been a priority of both administrations. However, this present iteration of the Trump administration is uniquely situated to set the market ablaze in ways that previous administrations could not.\n\n**Part II. Convergence, Timing, Trump Administration, Private Equity, Executive Action**\n\nAlright, so we have established that the US is seriously threatened by China‚Äôs stranglehold over this sector. What is this administration doing and who are the relevant people involved? I don‚Äôt have time to give you all of the reasons that point me in favor of a bullish sentiment on titanium, lithium, and rare earth minerals. Here are a few that I take to be really supportive, however.\n\nFirst, let me introduce you to **Ronald S. Lauder**, heir to the Est√©e Lauder cosmetics company. For whatever reason, this guy has a real penchant for minerals and mining. He is [*close friends* with Donald Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/trump-ukraine-rare-earth-minerals.html) and is, according to the NY times, the one that initially led Trump to turn his attention to Greenland. He is also very interested in Ukrainian minerals and metals.\n\nYou see, Ronald Lauder is a business partner of **Brian Menell**, CEO of private investment/equity firm [**Techmet**](https://www.techmet.com/), which seeks to expand production of precious minerals across our global assets to help ensure a secure and sustainable supply of the key metals for western-aligned interests.\n\nIf there is one company to look at and one company alone, it is Techmet. Recently, they have secured 180 million from **QIA**. They are **DOE and DFC** contractors with extremely lucrative deals over the last few years. Furthermore, what makes them unusual is that the DFC decided against their usual financing terms and actually went ahead and bought a direct stake in Techmet itself. That means the **US Federal Government** is a stakeholder directly aligned with the interests and priorities of Techmet.¬†\n\nAs if this was not enough, Techmet also has the investment/backing of energy behemoth Mercuria. They also hold advisory members and business partners from big name mining companies like Rio Tinto. Furthermore, their current chairman is **Admiral Mike Mullen** who was previously Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, as well as on the board of **General Motors. S**uffice to say that their present reach and influence over western government is compelling as anything I have ever seen before.¬†\n\nIf you are curious, here is the CEO Brian Menell two or so weeks ago discussing the present state of the administration and supply chain issues [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP9_PY5gEug&ab_channel=SmarterMarkets%E2%84%A2) He is bullish about this administration and highlights what needs to happen in order to compete with China effectively.¬†\n\nWhat does he stress? **Permitting, Bureaucracy Reform, Federal Incentivization.** He calls on the administration to lift regulations, give permits quickly, purchase directly and invest in western-aligned companies that are working on the energy transition. Trump is doing *exactly* this, from establishing the sovereign wealth fund, to the guidance issued by way of two executive actions ‚Äú[Unleashing American Energy‚Äù](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/), as well as¬† [‚ÄúUnleashing Prosperity through Deregulation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-prosperity-through-deregulation/).‚Äù\n\nI recommend you read the language, especially Section 9 of the executive order on energy. The order seeks to ‚Äúestablish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states‚Äù as well as ‚Äúto protect the United States' economic and national security and military preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation‚Äù\n\nBy way of the executive orders, federal agencies are instructed (within 60 days) to identify and eliminate barriers to efficient private investment and reduce project timelines for critical energy. Trump also instructs that priority should be placed on making sure USA funds critical mineral ventures and he also instructs to make sure the USA has an adequate stockpile of critical minerals/metals (and to purchase more if not). Emphasis is also placed on geologic mapping, and key western partnerships that share national¬† security interests, called the **‚ÄúQuad.‚Äù** If you are interested in further reading on this last point, I recommend[ this article ](https://www.orfonline.org/research/the-case-for-a-quad-mineral-security-partnership#_edn81)on Quadrilateral Mineral Partnerships.\n\nHere is another item in the order on Unleashing American Energy:\n\n>(j) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy that includes policy recommendations to enhance the competitiveness of American mining and refining companies in other mineral-wealthy nations.\n\nTrump is not a patient man. He will act quickly after receiving this report in March and he is already trying his best to wrap up Ukraine as quickly as possible too with assurances of mineral access. That's why I believe the shortest timeline to return is now to the end of Trump's term.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that Trump's team began negotiations without Ukraine precisely because they are seeking to get the best minerals deal possible. Russian advances on Ukraine have meant that many of the precious minerals the west is interested in now falls within Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. Having 50% of the rights to Ukraine's rare earth is not all that great, given this reality**. There is no guarantee that Ukraine will win the war (or when), nor is there a guarantee they will ever regain the territory.** Meanwhile, the US would presumably continue to pump money into Ukraine with no end in sight? Trump isn't going to be OK with that. I think he is working out a post-war deal with Russia that makes certain that minerals will be available immediately.\n\n**Part III: Positions**\n\nWhere to invest? Well, Techmet is private. However, there are still plays that can be made in this sector. Right now I have \\~$250,000 in derivatives and stock opened yesterday and today. Here is where I am at the moment, though I will absolutely re-balance as I continue to do research.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oclseac8cjke1.jpg?width=665&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48232bf2a19ed448757da6cc248dee2453ae6faa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nznu3bc8cjke1.jpg?width=690&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=22a30e2408d70fb47c95264a4a8137c11402d7d1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/am8i3ac8cjke1.jpg?width=671&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ca74d99bd71812608bbe3a7bcbe1c4779e5c156\n\nWhy did I pick these? (don't mind Humana or Uber)\n\n>**MP materials** is presently the only rare earth mine and processor in the United States.\n\n>**LYS** is AU but part of \"The Quad\" that Trump opens the door for investments towards when he writes \"(k) The Secretary of State shall consider opportunities to advance the mining and processing of minerals within the United States through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.\"\n\n>**REEMF** is self-explanatory, rare earth exploration\n\n>**CAT**  is at a 6 month low. I thought that this was a good time to get in given ramping of mining in future. They have ties to Ukraine's post-war rebuilding via the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council (USUBC).\n\n>**TSLA** (not pictured; getting calls Monday) as Elon Musk is close with Trump and shares concern over lithium in particular. TSLA has [just launched operations in a lithium processing plant in TX as well](https://cen.acs.org/energy/energy-storage-/Tesla-begins-making-lithium-chemicals/102/web/2024/12#:~:text=Credit:%20Tesla,lithium%20production%20in%20the%20US) and I would not be surprised to see substantial federal funding in the short term and medium term. See [also this article.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/where-does-tesla-get-its-lithium)\n\n>**UUUU** is largely uranium although they are branching out. I'm bullish on it because of this language: \"(c) ¬†The Secretary of the Interior shall instruct the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey to consider updating the Survey‚Äôs list of critical minerals, including for the potential of including uranium.\"\n\n>**IPX** up-and-coming titanium processing w/ a special patent.\n\n>**Other ideas:** Talon Metals (nickel, partnered with TSLA);  ABAT, Holtec, anything having to do with Brazilian Nickel or General Atomics; anything related to the Quad countries and rare earth / metals. I would welcome other suggestions regarding investments that get the right kind of exposure.\n\nI'll close with this. Brian Menell, after meeting Mr. Zelensky in NY alongside other energy executives in September, had this to say in a statement:\n\n>‚ÄúTechMet, together with our partners, is available to move forward with further work if the U.S. and Ukrainian governments instruct us to do so\"\n\nWestern interests will be ready at a moments notice. Will you be?",

          "selftext": "A few days ago, I saw the[ \\[DD\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ir0k5o/this_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_dd/) posted here about the mining industry. The OP of this post was right to point out that the mining sector is due for a massive run and I appreciated the attention they drew to the qualities of a high return opportunity.¬† However, their recommendation was mostly to invest in mining related to GOLD! Reading that was like watching one set the dining table beautifully, only to proceed to mistake the appetizer for the main dish.\n\nToday I‚Äôm going to provide further evidence for the case that the mining industry presents a massive opportunity on a timescale anywhere from right now to the end of Trump‚Äôs term. The investments that are going to make you rich, however, have nothing to do with gold, per se, and everything to do with titanium, lithium, rare earth minerals, and the complete market dominance China has over their processing and extraction.\n\n**Part I: Ukraine, Greenland, Russia, Cosmetic Moguls, and the Allied Supply Chain**\n\nWhy does Trump care so much about Greenland? Why is he so insistent on Ukraine signing away 50% of their claim to Ukraine‚Äôs minerals and, if that matters so much, why did he cut Ukraine out from the opening negotiations with Russia?\n\nThe answer is that it's all about the supply chain of minerals and metals. China is bending us over the table with their grip over the chain (80-90%+ dominance), especially in separation/processing of the materials. Recently, they [have gone as far as to ban key processing/separation materials needed](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-lithium-company-halts-tech-exports-trade-tensions-build-2025-02-18/), posturing to protect their interests in the face of American policy strides to distance themselves from their grip over the market. They have also kept costs of lithium and other precious earth and minerals artificially low, stymieing western incentive to establish their own supply chain.\n\n[China has been *SO* effective at doing all of this,](https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/china-dominant-mineral-mining-global-supply-chain-e2b7840e) that until the last few years, there was **ZERO** mining/processing of rare earth happening domestically in the USA. The picture wasn‚Äôt much better for other crucial metals and resources, such as lithium and titanium. We slept too long, took them for granted, and now here we are.\n\nDon‚Äôt understand the stakes? [Here is **Marco Rubio**](https://uscriticalmaterials.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Marco-Rubio-video.mp4), our present secretary of state and who has recently opened up peace negotiations with Russia over Ukraine, being an absolute doomer about the state of play with the supply chain. **Lindsey Graham -** another key Trump ally - also has eyes on the issue, especially as it pertains to Ukraine and what they may offer us for security (check out these tweets [here ](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1891046931323040187)and [here](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1799832487285465244)).\n\nLet me be clear that this is a bipartisan issue and it is *extremely* difficult to deny the threat this poses to our national security and economic prosperity (the previous administration came to the same conclusion). That is why it has been a priority of both administrations. However, this present iteration of the Trump administration is uniquely situated to set the market ablaze in ways that previous administrations could not.\n\n**Part II. Convergence, Timing, Trump Administration, Private Equity, Executive Action**\n\nAlright, so we have established that the US is seriously threatened by China‚Äôs stranglehold over this sector. What is this administration doing and who are the relevant people involved? I don‚Äôt have time to give you all of the reasons that point me in favor of a bullish sentiment on titanium, lithium, and rare earth minerals. Here are a few that I take to be really supportive, however.\n\nFirst, let me introduce you to **Ronald S. Lauder**, heir to the Est√©e Lauder cosmetics company. For whatever reason, this guy has a real penchant for minerals and mining. He is [*close friends* with Donald Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/trump-ukraine-rare-earth-minerals.html) and is, according to the NY times, the one that initially led Trump to turn his attention to Greenland. He is also very interested in Ukrainian minerals and metals.\n\nYou see, Ronald Lauder is a business partner of **Brian Menell**, CEO of private investment/equity firm [**Techmet**](https://www.techmet.com/), which seeks to expand production of precious minerals across our global assets to help ensure a secure and sustainable supply of the key metals for western-aligned interests.\n\nIf there is one company to look at and one company alone, it is Techmet. Recently, they have secured 180 million from **QIA**. They are **DOE and DFC** contractors with extremely lucrative deals over the last few years. Furthermore, what makes them unusual is that the DFC decided against their usual financing terms and actually went ahead and bought a direct stake in Techmet itself. That means the **US Federal Government** is a stakeholder directly aligned with the interests and priorities of Techmet.¬†\n\nAs if this was not enough, Techmet also has the investment/backing of energy behemoth Mercuria. They also hold advisory members and business partners from big name mining companies like Rio Tinto. Furthermore, their current chairman is **Admiral Mike Mullen** who was previously Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, as well as on the board of **General Motors. S**uffice to say that their present reach and influence over western government is compelling as anything I have ever seen before.¬†\n\nIf you are curious, here is the CEO Brian Menell two or so weeks ago discussing the present state of the administration and supply chain issues [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP9_PY5gEug&ab_channel=SmarterMarkets%E2%84%A2) He is bullish about this administration and highlights what needs to happen in order to compete with China effectively.¬†\n\nWhat does he stress? **Permitting, Bureaucracy Reform, Federal Incentivization.** He calls on the administration to lift regulations, give permits quickly, purchase directly and invest in western-aligned companies that are working on the energy transition. Trump is doing *exactly* this, from establishing the sovereign wealth fund, to the guidance issued by way of two executive actions ‚Äú[Unleashing American Energy‚Äù](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/), as well as¬† [‚ÄúUnleashing Prosperity through Deregulation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-prosperity-through-deregulation/).‚Äù\n\nI recommend you read the language, especially Section 9 of the executive order on energy. The order seeks to ‚Äúestablish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states‚Äù as well as ‚Äúto protect the United States' economic and national security and military preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation‚Äù\n\nBy way of the executive orders, federal agencies are instructed (within 60 days) to identify and eliminate barriers to efficient private investment and reduce project timelines for critical energy. Trump also instructs that priority should be placed on making sure USA funds critical mineral ventures and he also instructs to make sure the USA has an adequate stockpile of critical minerals/metals (and to purchase more if not). Emphasis is also placed on geologic mapping, and key western partnerships that share national¬† security interests, called the **‚ÄúQuad.‚Äù** If you are interested in further reading on this last point, I recommend[ this article ](https://www.orfonline.org/research/the-case-for-a-quad-mineral-security-partnership#_edn81)on Quadrilateral Mineral Partnerships.\n\nHere is another item in the order on Unleashing American Energy:\n\n>(j) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy that includes policy recommendations to enhance the competitiveness of American mining and refining companies in other mineral-wealthy nations.\n\nTrump is not a patient man. He will act quickly after receiving this report in March and he is already trying his best to wrap up Ukraine as quickly as possible too with assurances of mineral access.

Trump isn't going to be OK with that. I think he is working out a post-war deal with Russia that makes certain that minerals will be available immediately.\n\n**Part III: Positions**\n\nWhere to invest? Well, Techmet is private.

The OP of this post was right to point out that the mining sector is due for a massive run and I appreciated the attention they drew to the qualities of a high return opportunity.¬† However, their recommendation was mostly to invest in mining related to GOLD! Reading that was like watching one set the dining table beautifully, only to proceed to mistake the appetizer for the main dish.\n\nToday I‚Äôm going to provide further evidence for the case that the mining industry presents a massive opportunity on a timescale anywhere from right now to the end of Trump‚Äôs term. The investments that are going to make you rich, however, have nothing to do with gold, per se, and everything to do with titanium, lithium, rare earth minerals, and the complete market dominance China has over their processing and extraction.\n\n**Part I: Ukraine, Greenland, Russia, Cosmetic Moguls, and the Allied Supply Chain**\n\nWhy does Trump care so much about Greenland? Why is he so insistent on Ukraine signing away 50% of their claim to Ukraine‚Äôs minerals and, if that matters so much, why did he cut Ukraine out from the opening negotiations with Russia?\n\nThe answer is that it's all about the supply chain of minerals and metals. China is bending us over the table with their grip over the chain (80-90%+ dominance), especially in separation/processing of the materials. Recently, they [have gone as far as to ban key processing/separation materials needed](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-lithium-company-halts-tech-exports-trade-tensions-build-2025-02-18/), posturing to protect their interests in the face of American policy strides to distance themselves from their grip over the market. They have also kept costs of lithium and other precious earth and minerals artificially low, stymieing western incentive to establish their own supply chain.\n\n[China has been *SO* effective at doing all of this,](https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/china-dominant-mineral-mining-global-supply-chain-e2b7840e) that until the last few years, there was **ZERO** mining/processing of rare earth happening domestically in the USA. The picture wasn‚Äôt much better for other crucial metals and resources, such as lithium and titanium. We slept too long, took them for granted, and now here we are.\n\nDon‚Äôt understand the stakes? [Here is **Marco Rubio**](https://uscriticalmaterials.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Marco-Rubio-video.mp4), our present secretary of state and who has recently opened up peace negotiations with Russia over Ukraine, being an absolute doomer about the state of play with the supply chain. **Lindsey Graham -** another key Trump ally - also has eyes on the issue, especially as it pertains to Ukraine and what they may offer us for security (check out these tweets [here ](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1891046931323040187)and [here](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1799832487285465244)).\n\nLet me be clear that this is a bipartisan issue and it is *extremely* difficult to deny the threat this poses to our national security and economic prosperity (the previous administration came to the same conclusion). That is why it has been a priority of both administrations. However, this present iteration of the Trump administration is uniquely situated to set the market ablaze in ways that previous administrations could not.\n\n**Part II. Convergence, Timing, Trump Administration, Private Equity, Executive Action**\n\nAlright, so we have established that the US is seriously threatened by China‚Äôs stranglehold over this sector. What is this administration doing and who are the relevant people involved? I don‚Äôt have time to give you all of the reasons that point me in favor of a bullish sentiment on titanium, lithium, and rare earth minerals. Here are a few that I take to be really supportive, however.\n\nFirst, let me introduce you to **Ronald S. Lauder**, heir to the Est√©e Lauder cosmetics company. For whatever reason, this guy has a real penchant for minerals and mining. He is [*close friends* with Donald Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/trump-ukraine-rare-earth-minerals.html) and is, according to the NY times, the one that initially led Trump to turn his attention to Greenland. He is also very interested in Ukrainian minerals and metals.\n\nYou see, Ronald Lauder is a business partner of **Brian Menell**, CEO of private investment/equity firm [**Techmet**](https://www.techmet.com/), which seeks to expand production of precious minerals across our global assets to help ensure a secure and sustainable supply of the key metals for western-aligned interests.\n\nIf there is one company to look at and one company alone, it is Techmet. Recently, they have secured 180 million from **QIA**. They are **DOE and DFC** contractors with extremely lucrative deals over the last few years. Furthermore, what makes them unusual is that the DFC decided against their usual financing terms and actually went ahead and bought a direct stake in Techmet itself. That means the **US Federal Government** is a stakeholder directly aligned with the interests and priorities of Techmet.¬†\n\nAs if this was not enough, Techmet also has the investment/backing of energy behemoth Mercuria. They also hold advisory members and business partners from big name mining companies like Rio Tinto. Furthermore, their current chairman is **Admiral Mike Mullen** who was previously Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, as well as on the board of **General Motors. S**uffice to say that their present reach and influence over western government is compelling as anything I have ever seen before.¬†\n\nIf you are curious, here is the CEO Brian Menell two or so weeks ago discussing the present state of the administration and supply chain issues [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP9_PY5gEug&ab_channel=SmarterMarkets%E2%84%A2) He is bullish about this administration and highlights what needs to happen in order to compete with China effectively.¬†\n\nWhat does he stress? **Permitting, Bureaucracy Reform, Federal Incentivization.** He calls on the administration to lift regulations, give permits quickly, purchase directly and invest in western-aligned companies that are working on the energy transition. Trump is doing *exactly* this, from establishing the sovereign wealth fund, to the guidance issued by way of two executive actions ‚Äú[Unleashing American Energy‚Äù](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/), as well as¬† [‚ÄúUnleashing Prosperity through Deregulation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-prosperity-through-deregulation/).‚Äù\n\nI recommend you read the language, especially Section 9 of the executive order on energy. The order seeks to ‚Äúestablish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states‚Äù as well as ‚Äúto protect the United States' economic and national security and military preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation‚Äù\n\nBy way of the executive orders, federal agencies are instructed (within 60 days) to identify and eliminate barriers to efficient private investment and reduce project timelines for critical energy. Trump also instructs that priority should be placed on making sure USA funds critical mineral ventures and he also instructs to make sure the USA has an adequate stockpile of critical minerals/metals (and to purchase more if not). Emphasis is also placed on geologic mapping, and key western partnerships that share national¬† security interests, called the **‚ÄúQuad.‚Äù** If you are interested in further reading on this last point, I recommend[ this article ](https://www.orfonline.org/research/the-case-for-a-quad-mineral-security-partnership#_edn81)on Quadrilateral Mineral Partnerships.\n\nHere is another item in the order on Unleashing American Energy:\n\n>(j) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy that includes policy recommendations to enhance the competitiveness of American mining and refining companies in other mineral-wealthy nations.\n\nTrump is not a patient man. He will act quickly after receiving this report in March and he is already trying his best to wrap up Ukraine as quickly as possible too with assurances of mineral access. That's why I believe the shortest timeline to return is now to the end of Trump's term.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that Trump's team began negotiations without Ukraine precisely because they are seeking to get the best minerals deal possible. Russian advances on Ukraine have meant that many of the precious minerals the west is interested in now falls within Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. Having 50% of the rights to Ukraine's rare earth is not all that great, given this reality**. There is no guarantee that Ukraine will win the war (or when), nor is there a guarantee they will ever regain the territory.** Meanwhile, the US would presumably continue to pump money into Ukraine with no end in sight? Trump isn't going to be OK with that. I think he is working out a post-war deal with Russia that makes certain that minerals will be available immediately.\n\n**Part III: Positions**\n\nWhere to invest? Well, Techmet is private. However, there are still plays that can be made in this sector. Right now I have \\~$250,000 in derivatives and stock opened yesterday and today. Here is where I am at the moment, though I will absolutely re-balance as I continue to do research.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oclseac8cjke1.jpg?width=665&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48232bf2a19ed448757da6cc248dee2453ae6faa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nznu3bc8cjke1.jpg?width=690&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=22a30e2408d70fb47c95264a4a8137c11402d7d1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/am8i3ac8cjke1.jpg?width=671&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ca74d99bd71812608bbe3a7bcbe1c4779e5c156\n\nWhy did I pick these?

TSLA has [just launched operations in a lithium processing plant in TX as well](https://cen.acs.org/energy/energy-storage-/Tesla-begins-making-lithium-chemicals/102/web/2024/12#:~:text=Credit:%20Tesla,lithium%20production%20in%20the%20US) and I would not be surprised to see substantial federal funding in the short term and medium term. See [also this article.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/where-does-tesla-get-its-lithium)\n\n>**UUUU** is largely uranium although they are branching out. I'm bullish on it because of this language: \"(c) ¬†The Secretary of the Interior shall instruct the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey to consider updating the Survey‚Äôs list of critical minerals, including for the potential of including uranium.\"\n\n>**IPX** up-and-coming titanium processing w/ a special patent.\n\n>**Other ideas:** Talon Metals (nickel, partnered with TSLA);  ABAT, Holtec, anything having to do with Brazilian Nickel or General Atomics; anything related to the Quad countries and rare earth / metals. I would welcome other suggestions regarding investments that get the right kind of exposure.\n\nI'll close with this. Brian Menell, after meeting Mr. Zelensky in NY alongside other energy executives in September, had this to say in a statement:\n\n>‚ÄúTechMet, together with our partners, is available to move forward with further work if the U.S. and Ukrainian governments instruct us to do so\"\n\nWestern interests will be ready at a moments notice. Will you be?",

There is a slow down increase and with a nearest quantum chips release from IQVN, Google, Microsoft, I anticipate that this quarter can still have an increase but not impressive\n* So why I think Nvidia chips are stagnant?

          "selftext": "TLDR: Rivian is a BUY, because it‚Äôs cheap  \n\nPost earnings call, Rivian has found gross profit, reducing vehicle production costs by $30k.  \n\nEyeing the R2 release in a year, they‚Äôve sourced 95% of materials for it at half the cost of R1, seeing growing bargaining power in negotiations while realizing opportunities for production efficiencies.\n\nPeople are pumped about the R2 release.  \n\nWith $7B of cash they are guiding towards a <($2B) loss for 2025 -  \n\nleaving $5B of cash + $3.4B more from VW deal, putting them at a future $8.4B in cash alone for capex and expansion.  \n\nWhile the DOE loan might see pressure, they will also create **7500 US MANUFACTURING JOBS in Georgia**.  \n\nKilling manufacturing jobs isn‚Äôt really aligned with the current admin goals, even as they talk about ICE vehicles and the need to drill more.  \n\nGuidance for ‚Äò25 was conservatively flat given the environment, however -  \n\nWith Tesla protests happening and a deep fleet of existing owners, the Tesla to Rivian trade-up is happening in force, which will especially add to R2 demand and existing R1 demand.  \n\nBetween R2 revenue at minimum $4.5B in ‚Äò26, R1 sales, VW JV bringing in $2B in revenue (or more, as VW CEO has hinted at), potential further demand from other makers for Rivian tech,  \n\nAll of which doesn‚Äôt include EDV sales which just opened in February to other fleets, while they guide lower due to Amazon taking on slightly more orders in '24 and slightly less in '25, this is a unique differentiator that furthers the upside.\n\nRivian not only has a strong path to profitability, but likely future SPY inclusion as it reaches scale and profitability.  \n\nRivian is well capitalized, backed by big players who believe in their position, and most importantly -  \n\nPEOPLE LOVE THEIR PRODUCT.  \n\nIn the last year, Rivian is down 15%, while the company position and story becomes better and better.  \n\nLove the trade and upside here!\n\n(Positions: Long calls and shares)",

Yesterday they successfully put the first of Gen-3 satellites into orbit with the help of Rocket Lab.\n\n[https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-successfully-launches-60th-electron-first-of-multiple-missions-for-blacksky/](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-successfully-launches-60th-electron-first-of-multiple-missions-for-blacksky/)\n\nThe Gen-3 boasts an impressive step up vs Gen-2. Including:\n\n\\- 30 min delivery  \n\\- 35 cm resolution  \n\\- performant in low light\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zv45212lteke1.png?width=1256&format=png&auto=webp&s=72c588781a689debbdda90cade1d25f740b7298a\n\nWhat impresses me about the company is that have an absolutely ridiculous cadence of contracts announcements. We are talking new contracts week after week after week.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/srlxn6g8weke1.png?width=626&format=png&auto=webp&s=396635b4408c866ab77a3571771e993c9db90b14\n\nThis has resulted produced a smooth as butter compounding machine that has recently inflected to positive ebidtda.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/49f0wdblweke1.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bba22e008adc454b1a6bc6f9731ede73b71897b\n\nAs far as valuation goes, it stacks of pretty damn nice. For example, far better grow and lower ev / sales multiple compared to it's closest peer PL.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o0wzghh2xeke1.png?width=424&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa27eef224ebe52a3ac67bfde8c6bf4e03384765\n\nBack in the day they had a strategic partnership with PLTR. Not notably sure if it is still ongoing: \n\n[https://www.blacksky.com/blacksky-secures-investment-from-palantir-and-enters-into-multi-year-strategic-partnership-following-successful-pilot-project/](https://www.blacksky.com/blacksky-secures-investment-from-palantir-and-enters-into-multi-year-strategic-partnership-following-successful-pilot-project/)\n\n  \nIn sum, I think BKSY occupies a really interesting niche (high res, low latency imagery) that will likely be able to command really nice margins over time. And they have the benefit of a good liquidity and positive growth, so probably don't need to worry about being hammered by financing - as is the typical case with satellite companies - all that much.\n\nI am rolling with a good slug of commons, and some calls for extra juice.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/llssghcjxeke1.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=62ab5baedaff593425123cb81df6e6a7e161311b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sgxu3qrmxeke1.png?width=339&format=png&auto=webp&s=75a23bf587474d8ab210950f7d804fb998764bee\n\n",
