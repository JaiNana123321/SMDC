      "selftext": "A few days ago, I saw the[ \\[DD\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ir0k5o/this_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_dd/) posted here about the mining industry. The OP of this post was right to point out that the mining sector is due for a massive run and I appreciated the attention they drew to the qualities of a high return opportunity.  However, their recommendation was mostly to invest in mining related to GOLD! Reading that was like watching one set the dining table beautifully, only to proceed to mistake the appetizer for the main dish.\n\nToday I’m going to provide further evidence for the case that the mining industry presents a massive opportunity on a timescale anywhere from right now to the end of Trump’s term. The investments that are going to make you rich, however, have nothing to do with gold, per se, and everything to do with titanium, lithium, rare earth minerals, and the complete market dominance China has over their processing and extraction.\n\n**Part I: Ukraine, Greenland, Russia, Cosmetic Moguls, and the Allied Supply Chain**\n\nWhy does Trump care so much about Greenland? Why is he so insistent on Ukraine signing away 50% of their claim to Ukraine’s minerals and, if that matters so much, why did he cut Ukraine out from the opening negotiations with Russia?\n\nThe answer is that it's all about the supply chain of minerals and metals. China is bending us over the table with their grip over the chain (80-90%+ dominance), especially in separation/processing of the materials. Recently, they [have gone as far as to ban key processing/separation materials needed](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-lithium-company-halts-tech-exports-trade-tensions-build-2025-02-18/), posturing to protect their interests in the face of American policy strides to distance themselves from their grip over the market. They have also kept costs of lithium and other precious earth and minerals artificially low, stymieing western incentive to establish their own supply chain.\n\n[China has been *SO* effective at doing all of this,](https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/china-dominant-mineral-mining-global-supply-chain-e2b7840e) that until the last few years, there was **ZERO** mining/processing of rare earth happening domestically in the USA. The picture wasn’t much better for other crucial metals and resources, such as lithium and titanium. We slept too long, took them for granted, and now here we are.\n\nDon’t understand the stakes? [Here is **Marco Rubio**](https://uscriticalmaterials.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Marco-Rubio-video.mp4), our present secretary of state and who has recently opened up peace negotiations with Russia over Ukraine, being an absolute doomer about the state of play with the supply chain. **Lindsey Graham -** another key Trump ally - also has eyes on the issue, especially as it pertains to Ukraine and what they may offer us for security (check out these tweets [here ](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1891046931323040187)and [here](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1799832487285465244)).\n\nLet me be clear that this is a bipartisan issue and it is *extremely* difficult to deny the threat this poses to our national security and economic prosperity (the previous administration came to the same conclusion). That is why it has been a priority of both administrations. However, this present iteration of the Trump administration is uniquely situated to set the market ablaze in ways that previous administrations could not.\n\n**Part II. Convergence, Timing, Trump Administration, Private Equity, Executive Action**\n\nAlright, so we have established that the US is seriously threatened by China’s stranglehold over this sector. What is this administration doing and who are the relevant people involved? I don’t have time to give you all of the reasons that point me in favor of a bullish sentiment on titanium, lithium, and rare earth minerals. Here are a few that I take to be really supportive, however.\n\nFirst, let me introduce you to **Ronald S. Lauder**, heir to the Estée Lauder cosmetics company. For whatever reason, this guy has a real penchant for minerals and mining. He is [*close friends* with Donald Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/trump-ukraine-rare-earth-minerals.html) and is, according to the NY times, the one that initially led Trump to turn his attention to Greenland. He is also very interested in Ukrainian minerals and metals.\n\nYou see, Ronald Lauder is a business partner of **Brian Menell**, CEO of private investment/equity firm [**Techmet**](https://www.techmet.com/), which seeks to expand production of precious minerals across our global assets to help ensure a secure and sustainable supply of the key metals for western-aligned interests.\n\nIf there is one company to look at and one company alone, it is Techmet. Recently, they have secured 180 million from **QIA**. They are **DOE and DFC** contractors with extremely lucrative deals over the last few years. Furthermore, what makes them unusual is that the DFC decided against their usual financing terms and actually went ahead and bought a direct stake in Techmet itself. That means the **US Federal Government** is a stakeholder directly aligned with the interests and priorities of Techmet. \n\nAs if this was not enough, Techmet also has the investment/backing of energy behemoth Mercuria. They also hold advisory members and business partners from big name mining companies like Rio Tinto. Furthermore, their current chairman is **Admiral Mike Mullen** who was previously Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, as well as on the board of **General Motors. S**uffice to say that their present reach and influence over western government is compelling as anything I have ever seen before. \n\nIf you are curious, here is the CEO Brian Menell two or so weeks ago discussing the present state of the administration and supply chain issues [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP9_PY5gEug&ab_channel=SmarterMarkets%E2%84%A2) He is bullish about this administration and highlights what needs to happen in order to compete with China effectively. \n\nWhat does he stress? **Permitting, Bureaucracy Reform, Federal Incentivization.** He calls on the administration to lift regulations, give permits quickly, purchase directly and invest in western-aligned companies that are working on the energy transition. Trump is doing *exactly* this, from establishing the sovereign wealth fund, to the guidance issued by way of two executive actions “[Unleashing American Energy”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/), as well as  [“Unleashing Prosperity through Deregulation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-prosperity-through-deregulation/).”\n\nI recommend you read the language, especially Section 9 of the executive order on energy. The order seeks to “establish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states” as well as “to protect the United States' economic and national security and military preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation”\n\nBy way of the executive orders, federal agencies are instructed (within 60 days) to identify and eliminate barriers to efficient private investment and reduce project timelines for critical energy. Trump also instructs that priority should be placed on making sure USA funds critical mineral ventures and he also instructs to make sure the USA has an adequate stockpile of critical minerals/metals (and to purchase more if not). Emphasis is also placed on geologic mapping, and key western partnerships that share national  security interests, called the **“Quad.”** If you are interested in further reading on this last point, I recommend[ this article ](https://www.orfonline.org/research/the-case-for-a-quad-mineral-security-partnership#_edn81)on Quadrilateral Mineral Partnerships.\n\nHere is another item in the order on Unleashing American Energy:\n\n>(j) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy that includes policy recommendations to enhance the competitiveness of American mining and refining companies in other mineral-wealthy nations.\n\nTrump is not a patient man. He will act quickly after receiving this report in March and he is already trying his best to wrap up Ukraine as quickly as possible too with assurances of mineral access. That's why I believe the shortest timeline to return is now to the end of Trump's term.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that Trump's team began negotiations without Ukraine precisely because they are seeking to get the best minerals deal possible. Russian advances on Ukraine have meant that many of the precious minerals the west is interested in now falls within Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. Having 50% of the rights to Ukraine's rare earth is not all that great, given this reality**. There is no guarantee that Ukraine will win the war (or when), nor is there a guarantee they will ever regain the territory.** Meanwhile, the US would presumably continue to pump money into Ukraine with no end in sight? Trump isn't going to be OK with that. I think he is working out a post-war deal with Russia that makes certain that minerals will be available immediately.\n\n**Part III: Positions**\n\nWhere to invest? Well, Techmet is private. However, there are still plays that can be made in this sector. Right now I have \\~$250,000 in derivatives and stock opened yesterday and today. Here is where I am at the moment, though I will absolutely re-balance as I continue to do research.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oclseac8cjke1.jpg?width=665&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48232bf2a19ed448757da6cc248dee2453ae6faa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nznu3bc8cjke1.jpg?width=690&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=22a30e2408d70fb47c95264a4a8137c11402d7d1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/am8i3ac8cjke1.jpg?width=671&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ca74d99bd71812608bbe3a7bcbe1c4779e5c156\n\nWhy did I pick these? (don't mind Humana or Uber)\n\n>**MP materials** is presently the only rare earth mine and processor in the United States.\n\n>**LYS** is AU but part of \"The Quad\" that Trump opens the door for investments towards when he writes \"(k) The Secretary of State shall consider opportunities to advance the mining and processing of minerals within the United States through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.\"\n\n>**REEMF** is self-explanatory, rare earth exploration\n\n>**CAT**  is at a 6 month low. I thought that this was a good time to get in given ramping of mining in future. They have ties to Ukraine's post-war rebuilding via the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council (USUBC).\n\n>**TSLA** (not pictured; getting calls Monday) as Elon Musk is close with Trump and shares concern over lithium in particular. TSLA has [just launched operations in a lithium processing plant in TX as well](https://cen.acs.org/energy/energy-storage-/Tesla-begins-making-lithium-chemicals/102/web/2024/12#:~:text=Credit:%20Tesla,lithium%20production%20in%20the%20US) and I would not be surprised to see substantial federal funding in the short term and medium term. See [also this article.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/where-does-tesla-get-its-lithium)\n\n>**UUUU** is largely uranium although they are branching out. I'm bullish on it because of this language: \"(c)  The Secretary of the Interior shall instruct the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey to consider updating the Survey’s list of critical minerals, including for the potential of including uranium.\"\n\n>**IPX** up-and-coming titanium processing w/ a special patent.\n\n>**Other ideas:** Talon Metals (nickel, partnered with TSLA);  ABAT, Holtec, anything having to do with Brazilian Nickel or General Atomics; anything related to the Quad countries and rare earth / metals. I would welcome other suggestions regarding investments that get the right kind of exposure.\n\nI'll close with this. Brian Menell, after meeting Mr. Zelensky in NY alongside other energy executives in September, had this to say in a statement:\n\n>“TechMet, together with our partners, is available to move forward with further work if the U.S. and Ukrainian governments instruct us to do so\"\n\nWestern interests will be ready at a moments notice. Will you be?",

When China started imposing critical minerals ban a while back, I was informed to think about this market, but hesitated as I had little understanding of the market dynamics and its broader impetus.\n\nI think this is a Long game. We're unlikely to see short-term price upsurge, and even if it does, it'll be unsustainable. Expect volatility before a major breakout, which occurs when key milestones showing US-allied partnership production scaling. If short-term upsurge does occur, those relevant equities you mentioned won't be moved by fundamental analysis (productive capacity & growth takes time), but by geopoltical & regulatory hype.\n\nAlso forgot to mention: caution on allied matters. Australia is very likely to use these resources as bargaining chip with US, given recent strained ties/tariffs. I do expect Aus govt to revert back to an American lapdog trying to prove its loyalty, which it has done time and again, but getting the resource won't come that easy.\n\nPositions: \n- Aus: LYC (already secured Pentagon contract), ASM (potential US supplier), ILU LRV HAS BRE (undeveloped/ waiting), \n- US: PPTA (DOD fund), MP (Pentagon & GM), UAMY (secured govt, secured partnerships with US allies like Thailand, no new contract/funding but high potential)",
