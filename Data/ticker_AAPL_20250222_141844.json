It was popular when it first came out as it was the first cloud storage. \n\nNot to mention the whole corporate space using One Drive and windows ecosystem.\n\nOne drives only space (huh) or niche they capture is media sharing as it supports large files.\n\nDon't have cash at hand and might port some positions.
